In the response  the patch version gets cut off (clients should not care what happens in patch releases as they're just patches)  so `1.1` is intended: https://github.com/deis/deis/blob/6f00ed544d8d008ae8f5769b2581e7e1897f9249/controller/api/middleware.py#L32No change necessary  then :)

I hope the above fix will suffice  though.

I would probably lean for relying on my software to set this default  as it is probably subject to change.

The `compare` method only produces a partial ordering.  `ExternalSorter#keyComparator` gets away with the `Ordering[K]` falsehood only because later passes resolve hash collisions.

Rene wird aber mit dem XML-Parser bestimmt keine b-Variable setzen  dieser Code muss auch funktionieren (also abfangen)  wenn die Liste z.B. leer ist  also keine Objekte im Raum sind.Aber schön  dass du das auf die verwendung der get-Methoden umgeschrieben hast!

We have materials (such as derivative two phase material) that use the passed in argument to computeDF to look up derivatives in std::vectors. We will have to change these vectors to be indexed by the libMesh varnum as well. Of course that means having vectors with empty/undefined elements. This makes sanity checking a bit more complicated.We'll figure something out.

That doesn't sound like a good idea.1) Leaks metadata of who is in a group.2) More things to keep in Redis3) More bandwidth usage because those message will be sent out every time you connect to the socket and will eventually pile up over time.For the record:13:20 < _corbett> no. so b) say I get a message from someone in a group that I have left (due to asynchronicity). does the UI display?13:21 <@lilia> _corbett: oh i see13:21 <@lilia> i think we ignore any group messages before the create13:21 < jakeok> intuitively  i'd say don't display it13:21 < _corbett> or a) say I get a message for a group prior to getting the group create message (due to asychronicity) do I wait for the latter? display immediately?13:21 <@lilia> and send a leave-group to any messages received after the leave13:21 < _corbett> wellll…. it could happen I get messages out of order13:21 <@lilia> but odnt display them13:21 < _corbett> so the person sent the message thinking I was still a member of the group13:22 <@lilia> _corbett: you need to send them a leave group message until they stop13:22 < jakeok> yeah i feel like the right way to do it technically is to keep the messages stored  and if you get an initial group context  you can display those messages in the conversation that you received prior to the create13:22 <@rhodey> jakeok: ok  thanks for the heads up13:22 < _corbett> yes… but that breaks our asychronicity too I think. we don’t wait typically13:22 < _corbett> or try to impose order re a)13:22 < _corbett> so I’m both wondering how android handles it  and if we want to handle it that way long term13:23 <@lilia> i would not store rando group messages in the hope that the create is coming13:23 < _corbett> for now I want to handle it exactly as android.

If you `git grep ""if PY3"" -- tests` you'll see a few cases where we skip tests based on the python version  e.g.:        if PY3:            self.skipTest('No classic classes in PY3')Maybe the tests could only run if `enum` is importable -- that way it's a soft dependency and won't force users to install the `enum` module on py2."

SELECTs will extract the limit and offset value and/or parameter IDs and store them as instance variables  do a bunch of other work  and then finally create the top limit node near the end of ParsedSelectStmt's parse method.  There could be dependencies on the stored state  so I was wary of making select use this method too.I should have mentioned this in a comment.  I have a branch where the refactoring is complete---I need to run it against Jenkins to make sure there's no repercussions.

In this portion of the code  we're adding a new event  so neither was set to begin with  so there's no need to set something to None (though we could certainly do it and it would cause no problem).Elsewhere (in the EditEvent section)  the None becomes important in case you are toggling between partial- and full-day events.So  when you say 'I would remove those lines to reduce length'  if you are referring to the EditEvent section  you cannot remove them.  I tried it first without them  and got errors which led to finding out how the API worked in that situation.

This is the EditEvent section and they DO exist.  The 'patch' function does not actually remove anything... it just adds/replaces  so you must explicitly set these to None or the function will break.

Instead  you can build on it to achieve what you want as it should be flexible enough.I do agree we need to fix the blocking behavior of the wait loop but I'm not gonna live with `available() > 0` and `read() == -1`  it just doesn't make sense.

Starting here  I don't think we need to call ceph osd tree explicity here.  Contained in this osd.py source file there is already an osd_tree() function that can be re-used.I also think it would be worthwhile to look at the code in osd_list().  Specifically the part about gathering the osd tree from a monitor node.  This code  as written  goes to each server hosting the OSD and calls ""ceph osd tree"".  however  it is possible that OSD nodes do not have the cephx admin key that allows that command to work.  It would be better to gather the osd tree once from a monitor node up in destroy()  before going into the loop."

Since DerivativeParsedMaterialHelper overrides computeProperties  it is only materials that inherit directly from DerivativeBaseMaterial that use the computeDF  computeD2F  etc. functions. So  if we add the _arg_number in the computeProperties from DerivativeBaseMaterial  everything that inherits from DerivativeParsedMaterialHelper can stay the way it is.

It doesn't really serve as an abstraction on top of the core JDK method  is hard to understand without reading documentation and could cause compatibility problems between different JDKs. It would be better to explicitly provide methods like `isTransient`  etc. But I don't like that either  because it wouldn't be applicable to properties that only have a getter but no corresponding field (e.g. it's private  has a different name  etc.).How about a different approach: a config setting that allows to exclude transient properties form introspection. This way the exclusion can be implemented deep down in the `Introspector`  which is nice since it's supposed to be the only place to have unlimited access to the low-level class system information anyway.Would that work for you? Do you need other modifiers?

I think that using `require` isn't the best idea for Symfony  because we tell people to use `2.6.*`-style requirements  instead of `~2.6`  I guess to be a bit more conservative. Using `require` would - I believe - give us the tilde version. I did sort of re-word this section though. I think we should actually tell people to use `composer update` to upgrade their libraries. I think if they actually want a full new version of some non-Symfony library that's beyond what they originally put in their composer.json file  then they're on their own to do that (and this would be a common thing to do with Composer). Also  assuming more and more people use `composer require` to initially add a library  people will have constraints like `~1.2` more and more commonly  which means ""update"" will allow them patch and minor versions (and it make sense for them to knowingly opt-in if they want to change the major version)."

Presumably  the rho indices built for the spatial term would do fine for the temporal terms here because they're linear but I think we need to have separate bases in general.

What is your thoughts on:   1.   inclusion of dropout via a argument: `dropout =0.5`.    2.  The bidirectional layer. I think we can remove it?   3.  I think it has recently been more common to use LSTM's without peepholes. I have an implementation that works. To me the implementation will be messy unless we just add a seperateLSTM layer without peepholes. Without a seperate layer you need to add if's in init   get_parameters  and several places in get_output_for.

At least on osx when enabling c++11 Standard it seems that alot of Std:: stuff is Moved into the global namespace - and sadly Std:: has a bind Method aswell which for some reason Takes priority. I was not Able to fix the call to bind in a way that the Compiler would pick the correct Socket related bind. I even think that this should also be a Problem when compiling with c++11 and clang on Linux tbh. I am Open for suggestions of Course. Calling bind from the mptv namespace in the end makes the Compiler use the Socket bind (because there is no bind with matching signature in that namespace i guess)

Perhaps it's a good practice to use this tag instead of any custom ones: Before submitting a PR  the entire test suite should be run locally. If only a small subset of tests get run when you do that  you know you've left the `:focus` tag somewhere.

So `items.size` is the correct way to get the totalCount - this will be equivalent to the L1-norm of the counting vector once it's transformed into that.

I decided not to because the Skeleton is responsible for DOF name management (because each DOF in the skeleton must have a unique name)  so accessing DOFs by name should be done through the skeleton.Having the joints also keep track of DOF names seems redundant. And if we gave the joint class a function that uses the skeleton to look up DOFs it could be strange/confusing if someone asks a joint for a DOF that belongs to another joint.In my mind  the thing that makes the most sense is asking the Skeleton for access to a DOF if you want to access by name  and you should only go through the Joint to access a DOF if you want to access it by its index within that Joint.Let me know if that doesn't make sense.

So I decided to write it on my own.But to be honest  it still can not be used in a production env  lack of:- Fit such a wide variety of domains (different URLs)- Read speed- Memory performance- A fair mechanism for judging contentI've reconstructed the readability from Arc90's  and made a hight improvement:- Faster Than Any Readability Module- High Performance - Less memory- Automatic Read Title & Content- Follow Redirects- Automatic Decoding Content Encodings(Avoid Messy Codes  Especially Chinese)- Gzip/Deflate Support- Proxy Support- Generate User-Agent- Different outputs: JSON  TEXT and HTML.More important is that I am using `read-art` in the production - Spider/Crawl title && content from millions sites (only count domains). And it's very stable  quick and efficient.![data](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1418444/5593796/03624d76-9263-11e4-92b8-6b1671b5394d.jpg)![body](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1418444/5593797/03660736-9263-11e4-965b-9cb4a3cb7c5d.jpg)

This avoids a sanity-check exception which would otherwise be thrown.

Also note that the test is performed twice - both before and after the write (the first one checks if the user has permissions to change the fields at all  the second one ensures the object wasn't changed beyond those permissions).

You're right  that's inapplicable. It just seemed strange that try-except should be necessary to catch an exception that we want raised. I guess the intention is that a particular message is shown. Perhaps that's unnecessary  as it makes the test much harder to read  but I'm not especially concerned as long as the code is clear (i.e. add a comment  please).Also  never ever use `except:` without an exception type. Prefer `except Exception:` which will not catch `KeyboardInterrupt`.>  there seems to be no check for the expected_exception...And I agree  that looks like a bug in the `assert_raises_regex` implementation here  but shouldn't be true for the imported one I hope!!

Possibly you are right.Let me elaborate on the last example a bit:        obj.getSomethingMutablyBorrowsObj().someFunction(obj.name)  This can be rewritten as    let &mut  foo = obj.getSomethingMutablyBorrowsObj();    foo.someFunction(obj.name);And if getSomethingMutablyBorrowsObj is something like this:     fn getSomethingMutablyBorrowsObj(&'a mut self) -> &'a mut Something {        self.a ? self.obj1 : self.obj2     }  I understand that obj is mutably borrowed for lifetime of foo. The receiver in this case is foo and borrowing of obj has already happened while evaluating getSomething.

It will require one additional array for storing hashes (of size capacity * 2)  plus extra calls to save hashes (probably negligible) plus an extra compare + conditional jump in find() before comparing the key; which depending on the circumstances can be anything between ~2-4 CPU cycles (L1 cache hit   branch predicted) through ~7-15 CPU cycles (cache hit  branch mispredicted) to 1000+ CPU cycles worstcase (L2 cache miss when referencing the hashcodes array; quite improbable though considering our size of the queue). Most keys are found *in the first iteration*  so most of the time you'd just pay that extra cost for nothing  because you have to finally compare key value anyway. Actually  in one of the first versions I had a bug  where capacity of the hashtable was incorrectly 4 times bigger than should be  and the test coverage showed that this condition in line 93 was never false during the whole test suite (which led me to discover that bug with sizing  and added another test for that). BTW: There is one bigger thing I found by profiling that influences performance - there are some wasteful calls to `find` in `siftDown` and `siftUp`  because the same key is being moved (""bubble"" like) over and over again  instead of moving it only in the last step when its final position is known."

What I'm really keen to do though is abstract away all of this paging logic away from the individual methods. Paging should be implemented exactly once  and I think a nice way to do it is to make  accessor methods (`getVariants`  `getVariantSets`  etc) that are generators over all the objects specified in the request. There are some details about how we deal with pageTokens  but I'm sure we can figure this out. I outlined this idea in the discussion for #10 earlier.I guess the larger point here is that I don't see much of this code as 'final'; a lot of it needs to be aggressively refactored as we generalise to support the rest of the protocol. As we refactor it we should definitely examine the style and make sure that it's as easy as possible to understand.

There's more syntax features going on there so maybe that's unnecessarily complicated.

We could argue that it changed the semantics of `isset` for arrays that return false when the key exists but the value is null  though.

Same for `cnt`.2) `i` is later compared with `cnt` (i.e. line 669)  which is of type *size_t*. In theory  `cnt` could be quite large (len / 128)  possibly larger than *uint32_t*. So  I would rather use *size_t* for `i`.

In order to support side-by-side installation of multiple Rust versions  we should probably consider leaving PATH alone (or at least making this feature not selected by default)  and providing shortcuts in the Start menu that open console window with PATH set for the appropriate Rust version.Another interesting question is whether 32-bit and 64-bit versions should be considered the same product.   Right now they are  and installing  say  a 64-bit version uninstalls the 32-bit one (and vice-versa)  which is kinda bad.On the other hand  if we bundled both 32- and 64-bit versions of Rust libraries  there'd be no reason to want to install both  because one could just use the `--target` switch to select bitness of the generated executables.

I know  but I didn't found easy solution for this. Now it is really end of one +IPD block  so it is really end of the current stream. And by available() will be processed next block.Generally I think that is not ideal  that ESP8266 class itself implement Stream interface  because it is not just one stream. Better would be if library will return different stream instance for every incoming or outgoing connection.Theoretically stream can be created by receiving x CONNECT and closed by x CLOSED and can contain more +IPD blocks. But it is not so easy solution like current one.

If the argument is a function (checked by ```Utils.isFunc(options)``` ) then we know the user didn't provide search options.

I haven't toured the other handlers much  but this one does a lot more calculations than I would expect elsewhere  and those were not created with a mind to make sure that the input was correct. I fixed some holes  but I would have to re-write everything from scratch to be certain of understanding it well enough to cover all of the bases. So instead I made it easier to diagnose the problem when it came up again.

For example if rs.ok were True and res.early_escape were False  that could get you there  but based on perusing the _StageResult() initializers  these conditions should never arise.  This suggests to me that there is some redundant signaling between ok and early_escape  but I don't understand well enough what they do to say for sure.  What does the early_escap flag here really mean?

Any exception accrued on waiting should be send to any waiters.We need for timeout for closing handhsake -- if timeout is gone all waiters should get  `WebSocketClosed` exception and socket transport should be closed directly.

I think the path to doing what you're trying for here would be this:Step 1: Make a base class (or an interface - I'm thinking interface so we can multiply inherit)  let's call it KOSUserObject  from which ALL objects kerboscript sees derives from.  When a user does SET X TO 1. They don't get a native Integer  they get a KOSNumber which is a subclass of KOSUserObject.  When a user does SET S TO ""HELLO"" they don't get a native string  they get a KOSString  which is a subclass of KOSUserObject  and so on.Step 2: Enforce this in the stack and in the dictionary - making it only accept a limited set of objects - all of type KOSObject.  A KOSObject is either a KOSUserObject or a KOSMachineObject - UserObjects being the stuff script see and MachineObjects being stuff the VM needs to exist on the stack  like delegates and the like.Step 3: make it so that the LIST() that scripts use is only allowed to contain objects of type KOSUserObject."

If we were to tie this to `one_to_one`/`one_to_many`  then we're assuming that a `one_to_one`/`one_to_many` field will always be the canonical representation requiring action. GenericRelations show how this isn't necessarily the case.

So just make LookupTLBPageAddres return a unique value for that case and skip UpdateTLBEntry = moar speed increase.

If a file is deleted froma source unit  the source unit will only be recomputed if another filethat belongs to the source unit is changed. It makes sense to fix thiseventually  but I didn't think it was a blocking issue.It will handle renamed or moved files if they're added to git's index.The trade-off here is whether to rely on the file system's state orthe scm's state when making the decision of whether we should cache abuild file. I decided to go with the scm because there's an actionassociated with changed and unchanged source units: changed sourceunits need to be rebuilt  and unchanged source units need to becopied. Relying on a makefile makes sense when the choice is betweenaction and inaction. Additionally  we want srclib to know whatsource units have changed when we start rebuilding unchanged sourceunits that depend on units that have changed  and to check if a cachedbuild file exists before copying it. I think that relying on the scmfor this information is more clear.If we use globs to see if a makefile has changed  then we're relyingon every toolchain to pass us the correct globs (which isn't a bigdeal  but I think that doing less work with each individual toolchainis better reliability's sake)  and we're using the state of thefilesystem to tell us whether a file changed  instead of the scm. Idon't think that's a big deal for builds on our site  because thebehavior will be the same using either method  but for using srclibinteractively  ""srclib builds every unit that changed since the lastbuilt commit"" is more clear to me than ""srclib builds every unit sincethe last time it ran"". If a build of source unit can fail based on thestate of another source unit  then it's less reliable to rebuild basedon the file's modification time.I think getting the state of a repo from the scm makes more sense  butI'm open to the idea of using globs and mtimes instead if there's aconvincing case for it.This branch will do the right thing when given your example if the newfile is added to git's index (once I finish responding to your comments)."

I'm not too worried about this personally as I'm not aware of the module being used in Production yet  however in general it is somethign to be considered when making such changes.

Then you can make sure you only mark the uniform struct dirty when the zfreeze mode is actually changed.

This is a security issue (it can leak your database structure if a PDO exception happens). You should use ``getMessageKey`` and ``getMessageParameters`` to render the AuthenticationException to the user (translating the message key in the ``security`` domain to get in the right locale).But the template rendering the error should be fixed in the 2.3 branch  not here  because it applies to 2.3+Btw  currently  the code works  because it calls getMessage in the template.

If you think you prefer the more generic text  feel free to change it  but imo the current text is a better suit.

You've got an explicit mapping  and now  changing code far away from this method will break it  which is annoying.

If not  I'll follow this change with another one that changes this code to propagate the error and fail playback instead.

Remove the volume name parameter and use the given template name (or auto-generate a unique valif name).I see this method with just 3 parameters (in this order  which seems more natural given what you are trying to do): template  name and tier.

It's likely there are timing issue with this and that's the reason there is a wait loop (which isn't infinite btw).Without it what can happen is you can have `available() > 0` but `read() == -1` if you process too fast (you get the correct length from +IPD but `_serial` isn't available yet. It was a pain to debug because any addition to the code slows it and `read()` returns correctly.Maybe `available()` should be responsible for waiting for the next byte to be ready to read in `_serial` when `_available > 0`.

This is the domain before:```[    '|'         ('organization.coordinator.id'  '='  uid)         ('manager.id'  '='  uid) ]```And this is the domain after:```[    '|'         ('organization.coordinator'  '='  uid)     '|'         ('manager'  '='  uid)         ('members'  '='  uid) ]```Basically this change adds a new rule - `('members'  '='  uid) `. Note that Odoo domains use Polish notation - that's why the new `|` operator went where it went.The removal of `.id` is just a style change - I change my style preference in the meantime.

On the other hand it does however mean tighter coupling internally in sequelize  since the promise class suddenly needs to have knowlede about the sequelize options.Perhaps we should just hardcode the namespace to be sequelize  and have a cls: true / false flag in the sequelize constructor

It is needed in any case  but I am jsut questioning about the usability of the statement `Student[] students = new Student[5];`. Since  i don't see any purpose of this statement at all in your code  it is indeed not needed. And if you are using such for  looping   You should use `studentNames.length` instead of the pre-defined 5 length restriction.

The function will return the deviation defined by:![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/182937/5595086/95e197a0-9269-11e4-8509-2895b186de15.png)Where m(X) is our central point.

It could still be available for calls from the main menu etc  but at some point you might need to debug from the very beginning of the application. Then this would need to be done either in the App constructor  or at the beginning of App:init. It requires the config to be optional and the check for lua socket to lie earlier though.

If someone uses this link in a browser when using 2.3  it might get the wrong docs as current is currently 2.6. Using `2.3` is not a good idea either as it would be a nightmare to maintain over time. One thing I can think of is using a `any` (or anything else that would make more sense) version. When detecting this version  we would ask the user the version he is using and redirect to the appropriate page. What do you think?ping @symfony/deciders

It would be good to stick with one style. Elsewhere we've tended to use `is_expected` for its terseness (to keep the focus on the matchers) but this case is slightly weird in that the default subject is an instance of `Baz` (thus forcing you to explicitly define it).  Given that  I think I might favor using `specify { expect(Baz).to ... }`.

After I refactored to use the lazy-loaded connections that issue went away  but I think this did fix another issue in my system:I setup my database so that the amgut user only had access to the amgut database. To delete the database via psycopg2 I don't think you can specify the database to connect to (since you'll then be prevented from dropping it). There are no other databases my user had access to from which to delete the database  but deleting with dropdb did work.

Here's a slightly more radical idea  which I've implemented now: get rid of `Solver::PreSolve` and just use the constructors  since constructors now provide the same functionality. `SGDSolver::PreSolve`  which was the only actual `PreSolve`  remains as it was and gets called from the `SGDSolver` constructor.

Then you don't have the bitmasking and compares below to make sure it's a match.

So the renamed parameter is incorrect.I threw performance monitoring around most methods in the renderer to determine where time was spent. Yes  updateTick() probably doesn't have much cost  but I wasn't going to assume that. Feel free to strip some out as you go. In general I guess the approach is to have the monitor around some top level method  and only drilling down if more information is needed.I put them around methods rather than in methods simply because methods can have multiple return locations - having them around the methods avoid the need for try/finally or multiple endActivity statements  and basically dodges maintenance errors that introduce new return locations.The Performance monitor is different from profiling. Profiling will tell you how much time is spent in a given method over the life of the application  but we're more interested in how time is spent each frame  and if a frame is unusually slow - why was it slow? If a method takes a second once in the running of an application then that won't really show in the profile statistics - but that would be very noticeable for a user. It also drives the in-game monitoring metrics  which means a user can report where time is spent for them without them having to set up to run from source.

It fails to fully initialize the DatabaseManager via its `initialize()` method...this means that any DB migrations which depend on isOracle / isPostgres settings or `DatabaseManager.findDbKeyword()` (which are set in `initialize()`) will fail when you just run `dspace database migrate` (but those same DB migrations will succeed if you set `db.migration.automatic=true`). There are several migrations which utilize `MigrationUtils.dropDBConstraint()` which likely will not function properly with this change. https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/blob/master/dspace-api/src/main/java/org/dspace/storage/rdbms/MigrationUtils.java#L37I'm still not understanding your end goal here. In this PR  there seems to be some possible misunderstanding in how the Flyway DB integration actually initializes/upgrades a DSpace database. I don't quite understand what the problem is in the current Flyway DB integration  so it's hard to make a suggestion for how to make the changes you are attempting.

The `@` in `@private_key` is shorthand for `this` but because it's inside of a callback  `this` won't be what you expect. The solution to this is to change the line 308 from `zlib.deflateRaw xml  (err  deflated) ->` to `zlib.deflateRaw xml  (err  deflated) =>`. The `=>` (fat arrow) at the end will cause the callback to keep the context of the caller and everything will work as expected.

In other words: the static_cast is always applied to something with `.5` as fractional part.

I think many of our users have never used Rails and they might not even know what Rack is. They think ""here's my local machine and here are the override settings for my computer"" and ""there's github pages and here are the override settings for them"". The idea of `development`  `test`  `production`  etc are all foreign. I think `local` is a more approachable term (and it has fewer characters!) for newcomers. I agree that it's a divergence from Rails and Rack  but my gamble is that the semantic benefit of `local` will help. So a site might have:```text.| | - _config.yml| - _config.local.yml| - _config.github.yml```And that'd be it."

So if `lwork=None` in the `rq` function call  then for both the `gerqf` and `gor_un_grq` safecall  the `lwork` parameter will be None and the optimal size would be computed first.This is also the way it works in the existing `qr` function.It appears that both [orgrq](https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/521025) and [gerqf](https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/521024) have the same requirements and optimal `lwork`  so I think sharing across all of them isn't a problem in the case that `lwork` is explicitly set to something other than `None` or `-1`.

Not that it really matters. But nonetheless  it seems more correct: we've brought everything into the impl namespace  so those are the type parameters etc that are in scope.

If you wish to have this pull request auto-merged  please update it to only add lines.  If you don't think you've modified any lines  remember that I consider changing the whitespace (e.g. deleting a space at the end of a line) a modification  even though it may be hard to tell the difference on GitHub.

That can have strange side-effects in user code and it's a bit wasteful.How about reworking this to check whether the attribute is callable. You'll need to adjust the tests  but maybe something like:    def has_callable(obj  name):        return callable(getattr(obj  name))...and then use `has_callable()` instead of `has_method()`.  When the attribute doesn't exist we'll get `None` from `getattr()` and `callable()` will return `False`.

I blame it being post-vacation but I don't see how that connects. By default we **don't** expose secrets. So  by default this code is run and all things called ""password"" something gets redacted.

Then you want the ini file to say:```ini[stuff]#password=****************#password_hint=""Mother's maiden name?""#min_password_length=6```"

Is there an obvious choice for how the function should look? I am not too fond of the Index.ix-style methods. Perhaps modifying the signature to something like this would make sense?    SparseSeries.to_coo(ilevels=[(0  )  (1  )]  levels=None  sort_labels=False)So ilevels would take integer indices (like iloc) and levels would take labels (like .loc). And specifying both would be an error.

I'll update that. We decided that querying for all the results was costly and inefficient so that will no longer be an option.

This should be happening less  but in any case  I don't think this SerDe should be exploding in this manner. Alternately  we may want to throw custom exception to this effect that the invariant is violated and then handle it in the generic mapper or reducer. Perhaps that's better? We can badger on the invalid input etc.

Since this is documented elsewhere  I would include the link (you have this) and *not* the code-block. Let's make the *one* place we have this documented really great. I would probably do the same with the CIDR notation  though I think if we just mentioned that in the description  it feels ok (e.g. `... configures the IP addresses (e.g. 192.0.0.1  10.0.0.0/8)...`). It's not a hard rule  just trying to have less.

Yeah  I guess... to compose react elements like this  you have to have each piece be a valid react node. An array of react nodes is a react fragment (which is itself a react node).

I talk about it as ordering the parameters from the least likely to change to the most likely to change.  I think that more accurately reflects what we do.  Functions like `prop` don't have a function parameter to come first; and and occasionally the `data` parameter is really just a `datum` parameter.

This can cause problems.  Take this for example:```javascriptArray.prototype.foo = 'bar';var arr = [1  2  3];for (var i in arr) {  console.log(arr[i]);}//=> 1//=> 2//=> 3//=> barfor (var i in arr) {  if (arr.hasOwnProperty(i)) {    console.log(arr[i]);  }}//=> 1//=> 2//=> 3```The same goes for objects:```javascriptObject.prototype.foo = 'bar';var obj = {a: 1  b: 2  c: 3}for (var i in obj) { console.log(obj[i]); }//=> 1//=> 2//=> 3//=> barfor (var i in obj) {  if (obj.hasOwnProperty(i)) {    console.log(obj[i]);  }}//=> 1//=> 2//=> 3```Now consider if we're using objects with constructors:```javascriptfunction Foo (a  b  c) {  this.a = a;  this.b = b;  this.c = c;}Foo.prototype.printAll = function () {  for (var i in this) {    console.log(this[i]);  }}var foo = new Foo(1  2  3);foo.printAll();//=> 1//=> 2//=> 3//=> [Function]//=> bar// (guess why you shouldn't monkeypatch Object ;)```

This might not always be the optimal case. Perhaps we can introduce an ordering in the score (which defaults to alphabetically)?

I also think we should use `safe_indexing` utility would do the job here (although the call to `toscsr()` is probably still required). Speaking of which  the `safe_indexing` utility could raise a more meaning exception when calling it on a sparse array that does not support row-based indexing such as COO or CSC. (CSR  LIL and DOK all support row based indexing apparently).

If so  then the note is correct. The `/27` is a human splitting of the `/25`  so the netmask of the `/25` applies rather than what the `/27` would be. That means we can use `.224` but not `.255`.

In other words  if the response is public  then it *will* be cached by Symfony's reverse proxy.As I understand it  that *is* different than Varnish  where you need to do some VCL stuff  because by default it will not cache any response with headers. Is that right?My point is that this should be re-worded a little bit: some reverse proxies refuse to cache responses with cookies by default (Varnish) while others will cache them  which will mean that every user after the first will get a response with the wrong CSRF token.

In that case you can call 'getMenu' many times without having side effect of opening/closing menu.

To get a `Measurement` from a Series ID  could you then just do:```measurement := series[id].Measurement```1 less map? This assumes you have access to Measurement when creating the Series (I don't see why not).

(My only doubt was how it handled the merged cells.)Nik  could you confirm with the clients that they'd want to go down this route? It would mean that they wouldn't be able to change the header titles in the first 3 rows without impacting the software. It might also then be better to have this mapping in a config file  rather than in a ruby file. Is there a natural place to put such a file within the hierarchy? What do you guys think?

It can later be changed into a more sophisticated faction system (your dog is on your side/faction  the npcs dog is on their side/faction  the wild dog is on a third faction).Repeating `type->species.begin()` everywhere makes this more complicated. Seeing code like `this->getFaction() == other->getFaction()` is self documenting (comparing factions for obvious reasons)  comparing the species is less obvious (why only the first one?).

The API documentation suggests that we should consider making this a paginated interface  but doesn't say what that looks like:https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/display/AC/API+ThoughtsI think you should probably leave it as is for now  and in the future we should start to use the Django REST Framework for all of our APIs.

I like your idea of controlling the sleep delay in tests too-- actually sleeping to wait for time to elapse in tests doesn't really sit well with me.

The original created what were presumably easy to remember constants which have an identical name/function with the usart_common_all.c code. That way the call to usart_set_flow_control works the same on both the f0/l0 as well as the other chips from a function call level  but it uses a different register in the f0/l0 case. The `#define` is set up as the common constant.

If we have Unseen  Enqueued it can confusing whether a node can be Seen and still not enqueued. In all our version we enqueue a node when we see it for the first time. Is this ok?

I'll do that when we're merged and can refactor.I remember now that JS has always had factory methods for all nodes. I'll look again at converting everything to using factory methods when I next do a big refactor. We can probably find some common patterns in the codebase now that would benefit from that.

So if other tests have already tried to make dummies  there's a chance that the framework will have already called `CanCreateDummyOfType`.Right now if I make the change  it fails  as the method has been called 5 times  not 1.Of course  as I type this  I realize that I can reset the count in the test. Two secs.```csharp[Test]public void CanCreateDummyOfType_should_not_be_called_again_after_definition_for_a_dummy_type_is_found(){    // Clear the count  since CanCreateDummyOfType may have been called for other types    // in other tests.

So it is very important to keep things fresh for each unit test.  However  in the test below where I commented about using `before` is different because we are testing the output of the same action (same test).  So running `import` twice to test the same output is not necessary.

I optimized it because it was showing up in profiles.1. Avoids temporary string allocation by using a string array and then calling join.2. It attempts to avoid recompilation in the JS engine caused by setting `array.length`. 3. It's optimized for use in the reader rather than from an array view.We could change the one in utils to use this somehow.

It turns out that `List<T>` implements `IReadOnlyList<T>` and `IReadOnlyCollection<T>`.So if we change the dictionary code to create a regular `Dictionary<K V>` and return that  it _should_ just work.The one thing I don't like about that is a caller can mutate the ""readonly"" collections and dictionary by casting it to the concrete type.So there's several options:1. Do nothing. This is good enough. After all  it doesn't regress any existing situations.2. Change the code to return a `Dictionary<K V>` which fulfills the `IReadOnlyDictionary<K V>` contract. What this means is we don't add support for deserializing a `ReadOnlyDictionary<K  V>`.3. Add a new `ReadOnlyCollectionConstructorCache` that supports all the readonly collections. This would allow us to add support for the concrete readonly collections.4. Change `ConstructorCache` to understand readonly collections.@prabirshrestha which of these options do you most prefer. I'm leaning away from 4  but 1 - 3 seem acceptable to me :smile: and I'm happy to do the work."

This is backed up by the fact that the ""other"" side of a ForeignKey is a ManyToOneRel. It's worth noting that this same confusion exists in various [Entity-Relationship diagram notations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity–relationship_model#Cardinalities) - the side on which you put the visual ""many"" varies (c.f. Martin/Crow foot and IDEF1X notation). So  to some extent  this is a bikeshed; my preference would be to stick with the notation we've been using historically."

As for calibration of the high and low ends of the scale  I think the current ends are already pretty good  but could be made a tiny tad more extreme (lowest would be a tiny bit lower than your current low setting  highest would be a tiny bit higher than your current high setting - everything else would be spread evenly between those extremes)."

The `get_message/2` function will be called to resolve the media path. At this moment  if the voicemail metadata contains the `external_media_url` property  it will be returned. The `save_meta/4` was changed to add the `external_media_url` property  if it is present in the media document. So  when someone calls the mailbox  Kazoo will send Freeswitch the external URL instead of the resolved CouchDB URL. As Freeswitch will issue an http_get  the external application holding the media will have to handle these requests.

When the `compress css` thing works  it turns that into one file with a unique name. E.g. a3ed10efaa2.css and that gets reused throughout the management pages. So  if you make a combination of those two plus one more it gets a different unique name and the browser won't know it's already downloaded parts of it so you get excess downloaded. The solution would be to do this:```html{% compress css %}<link href=""{{ static('select2/select2.css') }}"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css""><link href=""{{ static('select2/select2-bootstrap.css') }}"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"">{% endcompress %}{% compress css %}<link href=""{{ static('manage/css/survey.css') }}"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"">{% endcompress %}``` "

I'm arguing that the increase in complexity is significant and unjustified. That is  I'd never use a tool like this across network boundaries where latency is significant. I'd just use the tool on the bastion hosts  in the local network  directly. I think that's much easier to ask and reason about than a first-order concept of bastion hosts.

I'm not entirely clear on how we're supposed to be treating the call number field. I want to say that it should correspond to the Library Catalog  but LCCN has been pretty much the standard value for most translators. If we're going with Call Number corresponding to current library  then we probably still want to store LCCN as one of the identifiers in the Extra field.I'm also not totally sure how Library Catalog/Call Number differ from Archive/Location in Archive. https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/item_types_and_fields talks about it a bit  but if you're working with archival material  what would you put in the Library Catalog/Call Number fields? Wouldn't the two sets be almost exclusive? Never worked with archival material myself  so I could be way off base here.In any case  we need to define these better and provide clear guidance (for both translator developers and Zotero users).

Don't change this now  but you could've committed this separately. Each commit should follow the Unix philosophy: do one thing  and do it well. This is so that it's easy to revert problematic commits without affecting other changes (e.g.  you might end up reverting some unrelated bug fixes  unintentionally)  and so it's easy to understand the project history. Check out these [guidelines for git commits][1]. `git add -p` is especially powerful for cases like the current one (basically it lets you stage _parts_ of your diff rather than the entire file at once).Also  once you're comfortable with git's basics  you could start using [`git rebase -i`][2] to amend  squash  or re-order commits  making sure they are well-formed before you publish them. That way you can make commits quickly when you're in the thick of coding without worrying too much and clean up later.Don't feel pressured to implement all this in your workflow immediately  but try to keep moving towards that end goal. It'll help a lot in the long run  I think.PS: I hope you don't mind me lecturing so much :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:[1]: http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project[2]: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase-i

Since there is no feedback on the screen whether you're changing the volume or not it becomes hard to know if you're actually changing it and by how much (though it's possible to open the menu). In addition to that there's no way to know if you're currently muted or not (**no visual indicator anywhere**)  I'd say it's easier to handle it if you're always unmuting first. The difference with normal television is that game are almost always able to pause so you could do that first before altering the volume.

The UI doesn't allow you to ever get lower than 1% (thus never actually muting) while this allows you to get to 0%. It's a bit odd to have the UI state it's at 0% but it actually can't be set to 0% without the keybinding. Do we want to change the UI to allow 0% or do we set this minimum to 1%?

Essentially the session stuff because that is bound to the controller environment.  I just explicitly require 'decko/location' in mods that use sessions.  Here we are only talking about the Card::Location methods.  We should discuss if you think we need this to be done differently before we can merge.  I think it is ok for some modules to have bindings to decko.  We would have to adapt those parts for a different web-context  but it probably isn't that hard to generalize this important touch point.  Could be as simple as being able to configure a replacement for Decko::Location via Cardio.

Are you using `N` as the number of states  or the number of factor bases? The former I'm against  because that would be an abuse of the type system/probably lead to type stability issues - it would be like storing `length` as a type parameter for `Array`. I'm more open-minded but still reluctant about the latter.

For example: the average (whether using `average` or `averageFrom`) of  say  `f(t) = t` is > t  and it diverges as `t` increases. That seems like a strange thing for an average to do.

I'm arguing against the user paying the cost of fetching that object or datatype up-front  by default. Consider that they might want to display a list of search results directly out of the index  using stored fields; forcing their search result to fetch each object in the list adds substantial latency. Also  since the `ResultCollection#each` method calls `[]` (which returns the RObject)  rather than yielding each document  they can't opt-out as easily.

That's intended; the `average` goes to time `-Inifnity`  whereas `averageFrom` does not.However  `averageFrom(h  0.0  e)` will converge to `average(h)` as `e` goes to infinity  which I think is the actual property you want to test.

My apologies. stopTwoLeft is the left drag boundary (for the second column) and stopTwoRigfht is the right drag boundary. We're allowing dragging such that the main column is at least 300px wide  and the right column is at least 200px wide..draggable() makes a jquery element draggable. first  I constrain the dragging to the X-axis.Second  I provide code to be executed when dragging begins. We set variables leftOneStart and leftThreeStart  which will be used in the following function:The second function specifies what happens when user drags the element. We are adjusting widths of the first and third column.Finally  containment specifies boundaries of the drag zone  which I defined earlier.

Both uploadInfo.uploadUrl and uploadInfo.readmeUrl are given to us as signed URLs that expire in 2 minutes.  So if you're on a slow connection and uploading the source takes two minutes  you might be unable to upload the docs.  (I don't know btw if the expires date is checked at beginning or end of PUT.)Could be fixed by parallelizing  or for that matter just putting the docs which are probably smaller first.

I was planning a similar thing  just using a non-signed file to start with (e.g. `tuf.NewClient(local  remote).Init([]*data.Key)`) and then using the local root.json in subsequent updates.I guess your comment is hinting at also verifying local files. This would require shipping root-keys.json and the client then keeping it in sync with any new root.json it downloads (to support revoking root keys for example).WDYT?

I think the more objects have prototypes rather than are just random arrays of other objects the easier to follow...

I can discuss that with @AhmedSoliman again. you can't use one replayer to replay collection events and object events. In the future you will need two types of replayers. One will replay only `created` events and another one for object events (update and delete). So don't write code that you aren't sure that you will need that.

The app should only start up listening after setting up the routes which specified by swagger docs in a async load. The a127 official demo is in this way [link](https://github.com/apigee-127/a127/blob/master/project-skeleton/app.js)It is ok to only include app.use(a127.middleware(swaggerConfig)); in the callback.

Issue 314 is that selective imports at module scope are currently always public  ie those symbols are leaked into any module that imports this module.  Since this selective import was added between major releases  I thought it best to reverse it  until issue 314 is fixed  so that it won't leak in the next release.

The evaluation includes side effects and reodering it would be disastrous  while an *lvalue* auto-borrow (and even an explicit borrow) can be placed anywhere between the evaluation of the lvalue and when it is actually needed (i.e. the argument is required for the call).Moving the borrows later effectively shrinks the duration of the borrow  potentially removing overlaps with other borrows  but never adding new overlaps.On top of that  we can also reorder *just* the evaluation of the autoderef on the receiver  not the entire receiver  spec'ing it as being evaluated as part of the second pass over the arguments. Even if restricting `Deref` impls to have no side-effects (using an `unsafe trait`) to get this behavior is doable  I don't think it's necessary.

But since you have a separate rule for it  that might be okay (Iforgot to mention that initially; sorry if I made it sound too big). I_think_ there should not be a problem with having makefile targets dependon the directory (as long as there's only one)  but I normally just put`.keep` in them to ensure they exist.PS  the `@` prefix suppresses output; the `-` prefix ignores errors.

For example  [Contact](https://github.com/dartsim/dart/blob/master/dart/collision/CollisionDetector.h#L60) and [ContactConstraint](https://github.com/dartsim/dart/blob/master/dart/constraint/ContactConstraint.h#L56) has members indexing starting from 1.

Even current master won't use it.It may or may not change performance for some non-commited to repo contributors fixers  and we can't test it.But if someone corrupt some tokens and have tokens like (_ for spaces):`=___`  `1` and want to set same code only to reparse into `=`  `___`  `1`we will change that behavior.Couse on 1.x we wont care about having valid every single token after each fixer  after this PR we will care. So we can start doing that early return.

(Dunno about non-core packages.)In fact  looking at the use of testOnly in our code  I suggest we should deprecate the TestOnly feature and just give every package a special symbol with a name like TestExports or something that is only exported to its own test package.  (Every other use of testOnly is to export a single symbol with a name like MinimongoTest.)

But  I agree that they could benefit from not being in async code either. If I do the thing I proposed above where we put the loop-handling code inside the `DiffApp` class  then we can easily organise it better.

Making it prefer tlbe->tag[tlbe->recent] first instead of tlbe->tag[0] should work.

I spoke with Fabien about versioning and he want to keep it simple - only one maintained version  even no patch releases.Due to that we may port some patches back into 1.4-dev until it will be released  but no further.Yes  it would be nothing wrong on throwing it back into 1.5  but it context given above we will gain nothing and someone merging it (let see... probably me;) ) will need to sit down and make some regression.Yes  I have done a little exception now.2.x line for next major  simply to much of it to handle it in one big PR.1.5 branch for not paralyze development  I have already asked for 1.4 release over 2 weeks ago :(

Can we add that to a new spec file and verify that things that should fail still fail? We can just run in manually and not put it in `npm test` or make a quick script around `npm test` that verifies that the fail count is correct.

This might be slightly faster  since it avoids having to put extra logic in LookupTLB (since update is far rarer). Is this acceptable  or is it wrong in a meaningful way?

If we want to re-use this logic  we should make those classes more general-purpose.  Right now they have implementation details specific to the fact that they are being ran as Guards.There is also currently a bug around `ResourceGuardInterpreter` that means they won't get evaluated in `why_run` mode.  Granted  you wouldn't get to this point in `why_run` mode anyways.

Particularly for people who are used to a particular shorthand that is different. For instance  above  there was a variable ```fn``` which I would assume is a reference to a function  but it's actually suppose to be filename. I don't have any associations with v  but I'm sure somebody does.That being said  I can imagine a style proposal (that would need to be documented and voted upon  presumably) where we reserve a few one letter variables like:variable name|type-------------------|-----v|GAVariantvs|GAVariantSetEtc  etc. This allows a controlled level of terseness and keeps everyone pretty sync'd about what names are appropriate.

Like this:```mako${_mdf('create your own snoovatar [here](/user/%(username)s/snoo)'  username=c.user.name)}```This should be safe and format properly. Was talking to @JordanMilne about this and a lot of this is confusing  so we might put together a cheat sheet of templating functions and when to use them.

For example  you can have something like:``` javascriptit(""deep3 is an object""  function() {  expect(result).to.be.an(""object"");});it(""deep3 has only one property""  function() {  expect(Object.keys(result).length).to.equal(1);});it(""deep2 is an object""  function() {  expect(result.deep2).to.be.an(""object"");});```The idea is to have readable output that gives you an idea of what is being tested.One thing I just noticed is that the data in `deep3.js` is a bit wrong.``` javascriptBitloader.define([""js/deep2""]  function(deep2) {  return {    ""deep3"": deep2  };});```should really be ``` javascriptBitloader.define([""js/deep2""]  function(deep2) {  return {    ""deep2"": deep2  };});```Those `deep` module can probably use a little adjustment to make more readable tests."

Can't we just use a global a.medusa or something? Also  the jstree usage here is a little concerning. I feel like we might use jstree outside of KRAD and outside of medusa. Is this styling intended to be global across the app? If not  maybe add a class to the jstree for medusa use that instead?

At present  not supplying a second param applies the PHP `DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR` constant for the path separator which means when used in a Windows environment  paths are returned with a `\` separator.  The change forces it to return Unix style `/` separators by default.  Yes  this is an edge case  but the fact is that it changes the default behavior of the endpoint and can cause a break in scripts using `JPath::clean()`.  Therefore  by the policy  because this is not a private method it must retain B/C until a major version increment.  In truth  we did a lot of things against that policy which is why we considered 3.3.0 to not follow the strategy published in 2014 but rather the previous version of the development strategy.

However  there's a reason the policy was written the way it is (something I had a hand in).  There isn't lenience for ""well  it probably won't break anything"" situations like this; it essentially comes down to ""Is this change breaking B/C?  If yes  do this..."" style logic.  It hurts our code base a little during the growth of a major release series  but the intent is to provide a stable API which doesn't introduce breaking changes in the middle of it.Perfect example  if you see the first working version of the install adapter code I worked on with a couple others a couple years ago and compare it to what is being proposed now  you'll see a lot more B/C considerations in the PRs; the original code took no consideration for that but having that end state (working code with a desired goal) allowed me to work backwards to integrate it in a B/C manner and introduce a roadmap into v4 (within those classes at least) and what B/C breaking changes are suggested to occur."

In fact the `execute_if_updated` method above explicitly returns `false` sometimes ([source code](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/8a1c3476a62005e3cb7cfe440da71b94fab8aa5b/activesupport/lib/active_support/file_update_checker.rb#L82L89)):```rubydef execute_if_updated  if updated?    execute    true  else    false  endend```---Looking back at the code now  I realize that a better alternative to the `.presence` above might be to explicitly declare a custom terminator for  `ActionDispatch::Reloader#to_prepare` and `#to_cleanup`  overriding for these specific case the default terminator  so they never halt the chain  not even when `false` is returned or `:abort` is thrown. In other words  replacing [these two lines](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/reloader.rb#L32L33):```rubydefine_callbacks :preparedefine_callbacks :cleanup```with something like:```rubydefine_callbacks :prepare  terminator: ->(target  result) { false }define_callbacks :cleanup  terminator: ->(target  result) { false }```@rafaelfranca Would you rather go this direction?

A Google search did not produce any documentation on this.Your workaround would work for simple cases. It will break apart unpredictably at more complex cases. Such unpredictably would really frustrate the users.What about debug mode with optimizations disabled? Would it still reorder stuff? What to do if you need a mutable borrow to evaluate parameters:    obj.paint(obj.x  obj.y  obj.getCachedOrDownloadImage())Or a mutable borrow to get to the function to call:    obj.getSomethingMutablyBorrowsObj().someFunction(obj.name)  To generalize self is just another parameter. If more than one parameter needs to borrow ob after a mutable borrow is done  there is no way out.We can either define an order that would work for most cases or leave it undefined and let compiler to figure out if there is a evaluation order that complies with borrow restrictions.It's much more likely that self will need a mutable borrow of obj than the other parameters. Thus I'm for evaluating self last to allow more code to work.

Having a class `PathsBaseTest_NoFileSystem` with a `initPath` feels wrong to me.IMO  if you need a base class for test that uses a mock path  its name should reflect that  maybe something like `WithMockPathsBaseTest` ...

I suggest using the request URL and HTTP verb as a permissions granule  and use a ""shortest match"" search for each request to find the appropriate permission. I'll show you what I mean:Let's say I want to GET /architectures/5/links/operatingsystemsthe system will try to see if my user has a valid permission like this:if I have permission to GET  /achitectures/* => return allow  else:if I have permission to GET  /achitectures/*/links/* => return allow  else:if I have permission to GET  /achitectures/*/links/operatingsystems => return allow  else: deny.@ares  You are way more familiar with the authorization mechanism in the system  what do you think? Is it doable? Am I on the right track?"

What is more  and that is a real problem to me  JUnit's `@{Before After}Class` methods are static (unlike TestNG's)  which means that I have to initialize/destroy a FileSystem after _each test_; that is expensive.I'm not sure about how to tackle this problem  really. I _do_ want to avoid having to create a `FileSystem` for each and every test  especially for classes which do not need to have one in the first place; and ideally I'd like to have the filesystem created and closed per test _class_ not per test  and have the test class initialize it with the contents needed  not the base class.This is a piece of cake with TestNG  not so with JUnit :(

Shouldn't `+(x  4)` result in the count of `x` being increased by 4?This was the reason why I asked the `totalCount` question about `items.size` vs. `items.sum` (the L1-norm) -- size would be equivalent to sum only if we restrict `+` to `+(x  1)`.

Each of the properties is responsible for a different property of the element: data-col is about margins (offset)  data-sizex is about width  so you can't put them in the same selector like you've shown.The only thing that I am not sure about  is moving both elements to a single loop. I don't think it is a better  because it will cause a less nicer CSS in the output that is more confusing:```css[data-col=1] {margin: ...}[data-sizex=1] {width: ...}[data-col=2] {margin: ...}[data-sizex=2] {width: ...}```

You can move the `category_names =` in front of line 62 so it would look like `category_names = loan_request.categories.map`. Then you can replace line 63 with `category.name` and remove `category_names` from line 65 since it will return it when the map is over.

Is there any reason we don't just call `PreSolve` from `Init`? That would simplify the logic and get rid of `initialized_`  as there would be no such thing as an uninitialized solver  and then it makes sense to do the base class initialization right in `Init`. I think I'll try it and update the PR.

This one in particular is a bit strange as I doubt the updateTick() method is of any relevance from a Performance perspective  as it is currently implemented (tick += deltaInMs * 1000;). Specifically  I intend as much as possible to place them -within- methods rather than around the method call. But the overarching question is  what should be monitored this way and what shouldn't? And isn't this monitoring the role of a standard profiler anyway rather than the code itself?

In the case of the FilesystemRepository  the resource is simply dumped to the filesystem and returned again as a File/DirectoryResource. The metadata will be lost  but in many cases accessing the body only will be sufficient.You could also implement another type of repository that uses `serialize()` and stores the resource metadata - for example - in a key-value store. There surely are plenty of other use cases and possible cache implementations  depending on what needs to be cached  how often the cache needs to be accessed/refreshed  how fast it needs to be etc.The point I'm trying to convey is: I want to give the users of Puli the chance to build custom repository implementations that are highly specialized to the needs of their applications. They can then take a generic repository (which may be less efficient  less effective  ...) and copy the resources to their own highly specialized one with very little effort.

It makes it easy to exclude them from the `lint-js` command. It also makes it clear that these scripts came from a third-party and should not be modified in the repo other than to upgrade the version. Keeping them contained in a single directory also makes it easier to change this to use an existing package manager (`npm`  `bower`  `volo`  `jam`  etc) rather than downloading them via `wget`. This is a general location for third-party client source files which might include CSS/LESS/SASS frameworks where nesting this under `js` would not make sense.

This mirrors the `lint-py` which calls the chosen Python linting tool which in this case defaults to `flake8` but could be `pylint` on another project. I have chosen `jshint` by default because that it my preference and I have a configuration I've been happy with. I can exclude this if there isn't a solid consensus on using `jshint`.

I had to look it up because I didnt believe it.

I think this can be done with a normal `Ember.View` (instead of a `Ember.ContainerView`).I created a JSBin [here](http://emberjs.jsbin.com/rwjblue/186/edit?html js output) with a tiny demo (would still need the `_boundComponentProps` stuff you have. The basic gist is that adding a child view in `render` is cleared for every `rerender`.  You could extend `packages/ember-views/lib/mixins/normalized_rerender_if_needed.js` and set the `componentNameStream` at `lazyValue` (like [BoundPartialView](packages/ember-views/lib/views/bound_partial_view.js)).@mmun / @mixonic - Does you agree?

It is just two independent digits between 0-9 encoded into an int (although one of them is more of an enum than a scale)  so the int should be between 00 and 99. Since we are about to decompress it again using pngquant  so I set it to the quickest which is 00 by looking at the docs.

It is this sort of things that I had in mind when I recommended that Manasvi stops implementing anything new for a few days and instead spend some time on designing the API interfaces mentioned in the PPT slides.  I would actually like to see and actual (Java) interface fully defined first  and then everything Manasvi does from there on to be to implement that interface.  And I think that we should all participate in the design of the interface.

Basically when a purgeAssets() operation is submitted  poppy will instruct the CDN provider to purge those assets from their edge.  It may take some time for the CDN operator to purge the asset across their entire edge network.  When a user then accesses the site  the edge will pull from origin if that content has been purged from the edge server being accessed.If that content is no longer found at origin  then the edge server will return a 404.  As that is handled by the provider  I recommend reading the provider docs  but this is generally how it works with most providers.

Do you mean `allowed_to_migrate` instead of `allow_migrate`?2. `self` doesn't exist in this context as the `forwards` method is a function callback and not an object callback.3.  I am getting a little worried because although these changes are in the best interest of documentation  the code is now so abstracted from my own project that testing these suggestions is now unfortunately impossible.For instance switching the code to somehow reference the Migration is beyond my ability to do with the time I have set aside to help in this area.  Any ideas?  All other changes are now incorporated.  Perhaps we should just document that the router must exist for all time and leave it be?  Or is there a simple way to fix the `this. allowed_to_migrate()` issue?All other inputs have been taken.  Can you help me get a reference to the Migration from within the `forwards` method so we can wrap this up?

Пузырь контраст эхокардиографии (пузырь эхо) могут быть использованы в качестве скрининга для выявления аномальных связи между артерий и вен легких. Это включает в себя введение перемешиваемой физиологического раствора в вену  а затем с помощью ультразвука на основе визуализации сердца. Как правило  легкие удалить мелкие пузырьки воздуха из кровотока  и они  следовательно  можно увидеть только в правом предсердии и правом желудочке. Если AVM присутствует  появляются пузырьки в левом предсердии и левом желудочке  как правило  3-10 сердечных цикла после правой стороны; это медленнее  чем в пороков сердца  в которых есть прямые связи между правой и левой стороны сердца.Большее количество пузырьков  скорее всего  указывают на наличие АВМ. Bubble эхо не является идеальным инструментом отбора  как он может пропустить мелкие АВМ и не определить место АВМ. Часто контрастным усилением компьютерной томографии (КТ ангиография) используется для идентификации поражений легких; этот метод имеет чувствительность более 90%. [1] [2] Это может быть можно опустить контрастности управления на современных компьютерных томографов. [5] Эхокардиография также используется  если есть подозрение на легочной гипертензии или высокой выходной сердечной недостаточности из-за больших поражений печени  иногда с последующим катетеризации сердца для измерения давления внутри различных камер сердца.

This is needed because the workers are dynamically-defined  so the queues would be paused indefinitely and jobs wouldn't be processed.After we dynamically add a worker using `register_worker!`  `Shoryuken.workers.include? queue` will return `true`  then it should stop constantly pausing.

But that general idea requires that the FIRST step be to make it so we wrapper around all the primitives like string  float  int  etc.  Then you can make a List that requires its members to be of type kOSObject  where kOSObject is the base all our wrappers derive from.But this... this is only halfway there and I'm not sure if that's worth the work because it would just have to be gutted and done over again later when the full solution happens.What was the rationale for WHY we needed a list that is only allowed to contain suffixed items  but don't need one to contain other kOS objects.  What was the use case this was trying to solve?

I just pulled up the code in your branch and It looks like the controller is still including Card::Location  so we're not ready to go to mods.Now that I've looked there  I'm a little surprised to see that wagn is depending upon decko-rails  but I think that's ok for now.

Shouldn't we handle that in a standard way in migrations?  Seems like you might even want configured options about how to handle name conflicts in the cardname and codename spaces.  We can do like it used to do a long time ago and change the name to URI1 and still use the codename for the original name.  A codename collision is going to be either an error  or re-running the same migration.

You are talking about aliasing uri and url  and I'm saying we leave that alone as far as view names.  The raw view of the new type already returns the bare uri  so we don't need another one for that  just a way to make it a link with the link also as the text.How about {{a uri card|title:_raw}} or something else.  Some coding in title to say 'use the card's raw content'  which is what we want for this feature.

This should just work but obviously it doesn't for some reason. It might be better to change CurrentErrors to use fsharpbinding.errors() instead of fsharpbinding.errors_current() for 7.3 as this will cause it to send a parse request synchonously.

So I don't like the _raw idea.  (especially since underscore already has a meaning in name contexts and it doesn't have to deal with views).Basically  I think we just need a uri_link view.  Isn't that easier?

Can't say that's come up before  but it could prove useful at some point.

(Which we don't need right now.)On the other hand  `std::shared_ptr` enables the use of `std::weak_ptr` which might simplify the implementation of some things (mostly scheduler/lock related) as they're further de-Handled. I don't think it'll be a big help  however. (Might in-fact be more complicated  code-wise.)So it's mostly memory-related concerns from me plus the fact that the `boost::intrusive_ptr` implementation is relatively tiny. (I only had to add 500 lines to our boost repo for it.)

The `play`/`shutdown` names aren't necessary. That comes from an earlier time  when you needed to provide all the responses before you called `play`  and it was intended to offer a record/replay experience.

From what I can see  the code rather than blocking clients sending movement packets when rooted  releases the root. Which is bad. Probably if the packets were blocked  the offending client would ""move"" but all other players wouldn't see them move and the server would put them in their original place. Isn't this a better overall solution?In any case  even if you did this. Other players wouldn't see the turrets of the cannons moving. I'm pretty sure this would be equally wrong. So  I think it has to be allowed here. I'm not sure how easy it would be to isolate axis movement rather than location movement here though.That would be the 100% ""correct"" way to do it and should prevent any spoofing freezes.Would you agree?"

One of the pieces of information this API will return is the CDN domain name when you perform a `$cdnService->getService({serviceId})` operation. After that point  the user can simply suffix the relative path of their asset to this domain name.When all assets are purged via the `$service->purgeAssets()` operation  if the user were to request that asset via the asset URL  the service would not find the asset in its caches (located on edge nodes) and try to request it from the origin server at that point. This is my understanding but perhaps @amitgandhinz can confirm.

Or at least  you don't need to accept any parameters. The reason I say this is that when you instantiate the class  whatever you **give** it is not **set** during ```__init__```. This means that essentially your Visual object is out of date compared to the VMDB system  which is something we want to avoid. I also think that your *properties* should have **db** enabled functions too  though this is less of an issue and more of a future enhancement.

I think we can do better here. I guess we should use the header locator instead as the problem concerned the whole header. This made me notice that the [header class](https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/master/tests/python/gaia-ui-tests/gaiatest/apps/email/app.py#L199) has access to the entire page. I think we should restrict its scope like we do [here for instance](https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/master/tests/python/gaia-ui-tests/gaiatest/apps/contacts/app.py#L124).In other words  if we restrict the header to a [PageRegion](https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/master/tests/python/gaia-ui-tests/gaiatest/apps/base.py#L133)  we would have to define the locator of the header (`By.CSS_SELECTOR  .msg-list-header`) inside the Email page class. Then we would be able to use it in the test this unsual call `len(self.marionette.find_elements(email.header_locator))`.What do you think about that?

Returning Void could mean to things: - one file has been deleted- no file has been deleted I favour keeping the DeleteResult in this case.For acknowledged writes we could check if the correct number of chunks has been deleted as well and return an error if not? However if such a operation fails  this usually leaves the database in an inconsistent state. I was wondering if we should provide an option to mark the files document as being deleted before issuing any actual delete operation  delete the chunks first and then finally delete the files document. That at least would make it easy to find any GridFS files where anything went wrong."

Using an `Optional` for `getPickupDelay` and `getDespawnTime` didn't make sense  because you're not indicating the lack of a value - just an infinite one

Instead of discussing `what-if` and lazy argument evaluation together  I suggest:a) Identifying that users can't really call `transact-on-db` directly  because if they provide e.g. a literal list of them in a REPL  the list will be evaluated b) We thus provide a higher-level `transact` call  which is actually a macro. The reason why this helps is because we basically get a form of lazy evaluation out of it. Instead of parameterizing `_transact` at this stage  I would explicitly call `*swap*` from within `_transact` to support only this use case.c) Go through your macro expansion examples for `_transact` to describe how this works in practice.d) Split out the `what-if` implementation into a short subsection. Here's where you can refactor `_transact` to take a post-update function.I would also make it more explicit that `transact-on-db` requires an `*Atom*` and not a bare database (why can't `transact-on-db` call `*Atom*` on `initial-db` itself as a first step?)I'm going to hold off on mutating this section until you've had a chance to respond to this :)

But there's an easier way.Instead of cloning from a template request and replacing pretty much everything in it  the entire patch request can be generated here.Bucket bucket = new Bucket()    .setLogging(new Bucket.Logging()     .setLogBucket(Globals.LOGS_BUCKET_NAME)      .setLogObjectPrefix(objectName));      return gcsClient.buckets().patch(objectName  bucket);There's no use for a template request.

But also it's a very different variable  so idk

It is also possible to call the WorldServer#func_180505_a for the count of particles if needed.

Create a method `agency_data` that runs the four private methods. You don't have to initialize a variable for each step. I don't think you use it elsewhere. Then for each row in the CSV you can just call `Agency.create(agency_data)`.

It looks weird but whatever. Then you can just do `Agency.create(collect_agency_data(row_data  food_type_ids)`. Maybe rename  and then I think you can work on getting rid of the arguments.

Can invoking pandoc be conditional on using msi for now? I'll probably merge this without turning on msi generation on the bots at first (because it's going to require re-imaging the VMs to contain WIX and pandoc)  and if pandoc is invoked unconditionally it'll break the build.

My HMAC stuff uses RestClient and the OAuth stuff uses Faraday which have subtle differences in headers. I think it's better to just test the headers this gem adds.

This way we can run the tests twice like so: `rspec` and `env USE_HMAC=true rspec`. I'm not a huge fan of this so let me know if you think of anything else.

If you think otherwise  tell me what it would do?  What would the link be targeted at?  This is what I'm saying.  The core view for most types is not a link  but it is for this type.  So  the url_link view is a link for this type because the target is the raw content of my card. exactly like the core view  it's just that I also want that content in the <a> element content.  There isn't really an equivalent to this for other types.  Core may not be right  maybe raw  but I don't see what other option would give something that makes sense.

Since <code>selendroid</code> already used <code>device</code> for for both emulator and real hardware as object under test.2. <code>model</code> is only used in the limitation of real hardware objectTherefore I think <code>deviceType</code> is a logical choice to specify a different type of device to test if it is is an emulator  or a different type of model if it is a hardware device. Other than that  there is no special reasons to use <code>deviceType</code> in place of <code>model</code>.

Looks good  whatever way you decide to implement it. If we get a firm implementation  we can either backport the change as a ` .diff ` until the next release. Generally speaking  if something is committed upstream  we're happy to use it in-formula until the next release makes it redundant.

I wouldn't mind a S3TaskSubscription class in s3notify.py either *if* it is properly generalized and thus re-usable across use-cases.

See #1650 for more—definitely willing to discuss  mind you. This just makes things easier to read in the generated documentation  IMO  while not interfering too much with reading the docs in code.

I also think we typically try to list function types as a single type  ie. without spaces:```scala  def toInputStreamParser(simpleParser: String=>Box[NodeSeq]): InputStream=>Box[NodeSeq] = {  ...```

Personal preference here  since there isn't a clear style preference in the Lift code that I've seen.

Not sure what others think. Also  would it make sense to make this an `apply` instead of `.basic`? I feel like the `basic` vs `full` distinction doesn't matter that much to the user.

I didn't realize that it was doing this by checking that it was not something else.So  I do see how it would fail for `data:image`  however `'data:image....` is getting passed in. Note the leading quotation mark. Would it make more sense to strip out that quotation mark in this method or require the caller to strip it out? Or is this an issue with the `Quoted` prototype?

Maybe if you were doing an update_all  you would get the ids in groups and do an update_all on the query for that set of ids  but we (often) need to do something to each card so we want the objects (in groups).

It also motivates me to remove from EE.I'll look into the better syntax. I started there and I ended up with this for probably bad reasons  but I forget exactly why.

One of the issues with not using it is that currently we don't store the associated src on the TextTrack objects themselves but if we did and we recreated the tracks  we would need to make another request (though  it should be cached) and parse the vtt file again  so  I thought just stuffing it back in was reasonable  if not great.The main reason that `addTrack_` is pseudo-private is that we need a way to add items to the list internally but it isn't part of the official API spec.

At this point in the code  `name` is bound to an integer and `name <= 0` cannot raise a `ZeroDivisionError` because no division is occurring. Even if it did raise that exception  `value` is not used after its assignment.

It's relatively  incredibly inefficient to iterate over the keys in the dictionary to find the desired value.

Since `send_thankyou()` adds the donor's name to `Donators`  `i == DonorName` must evaluate to `True` at some iteration in the loop. This means line 30's `return` statement will occur before the loop exhausts the list  so the `else` clause will never be reached. Based on the body of the `else`  `print u""Enter an integer:""`  I suspect this is not operating as you intended. "

Remove line 22 from happy.Also  I would move the testing of `total_cost` into a separate (single scenario). That will help reduce the number of things you are testing in a scenario. Also  line 17 and 18 will no longer be relevant. So your test would reduce to lines 17  19  20  21  23 for the happy path. For sad  you would have line 22 instead of 23.

Teams or something like them stays.The goal of roles is to apply a consistent set of policy rules similar to how team abstracts a group of people.  You have the pieces of that  but I'm not sure that the distinct binding resources are necessary.Use case: I want to apply the same set of policy and roles to large numbers of project. When a new project is created it automatically gets a policy and roles. As an admin  I can globally change the policy of a single role and have it applied to all projects using that policy.Use case: I want to customize the policy of a project  and have that policy inherit the bulk of its logic from the original policy.  Is it acceptable for the policy to be copied (so now there are two policies)?  If an admin customizes that policy  it's likely they want to reuse that customized policy.Open questions:1. How do admins ensure the right policy is assigned on project creation?  Does a deployer of OpenShift have to wrap project creation?2.

You guys seem to really like the inverted form of if statements.  Personally  I tend to think it's easier to understand ""if the component has a render function  throw an error"" rather than ""assert that render is null *OR* that the render property is not a function"".  The former is closer to the semantic reasoning  while the latter feels like ~~demorganized~~ **compiled** output.  The exclamation point out front just converts the ""invariant"" into an ""if""  and the inside of the ""if"" is the failure condition.  I know both are technically relying on short-circuit evaluation  but it just feels easier to reason about the former.  Anyway  that's my two cents.  Updated diff uses demorganized form."

Also  it's preferable to use SQL for ordering and limiting rows. Here we're getting every review from the DB but we're only displaying three. It would save bandwidth to only retrieve the latest three from the DB:```rubyclass Pizzeria  has_many :reviews  def latest_reviews    reviews.order(created_at: :desc).limit(3)  endend```And then ```HTML+ERB<% pizzeria.latest_reviews.each do |review| %>```

For user ease  I was thinking:```php  $sandbox_me = isset($_ENV['DEP_NAME']);```That env var (name is at the mercy of cloudcontrol  unfortunately) wouldn't need to be set by users (unless they want to force local sandboxing). That var would be set for all production hosting environments though (cloudcontrol and heroku).  This way  a user simply has to download the project  serve locally  and then visit the local hostname for an unsandboxed experience – no fiddling with the code is necessary. It also makes for a seamless upgrade path.I'll merge this in as is and  if you agree  change it to the env var solution in a follow up commit.

So you could end up having tests interfere with each other. Most of the slow down from running tests is from SmaliClassManager  and within that  mostly from looking up reflib.zip entries. That caching can probably be made static  so it doesn't happen every time a SmaliClassManager is instantiated (and VirtualMachine). It might even make more sense to have a constructor that doesn't cache framework classes.

I can fix things up during merge. One last thing I wanted to check with you was whether using `normalizePath` is better than using `path.expand`. From the documentation it looks like `normalizePath` calls `path.expand` first and then also handles things like `../` etc.

So far as I can see the player inherits the unit state. Hence why this works fine. All I think should be done is correct the comment.I did originally read from the template.. But  I think the problem there is if somehow the root is legitimately removed  this would break that.Checking the root flag on the player seems to work fine though.

This will be how wsgi starts the app. However  `run_server.py` will override this since it is used only for local testing.

I can move it  but I'm pretty sure most of the devices we want to connect to will need it. I also see this class as filling out a little more as we discover more about the devices we connect to.

I really like using `from RuddockWebsite import module` and later `module.function()`  but otherwise we can also do `from Ruddockwebsite.decorators import login_required` instead of `import *`.For constants I prefer `import RuddockWebsite.constants as const` and `const.VALUE` over `import *` also.

It's a shame as often  emulators whose code will remains for years have bad portability. It's also a reason why I tent to prefer shortness and brevity over _compiler compliant_ writing: Emulator code should focus on readability over performance as it make life of potential future contributors easier.I'm not a compiler expert but if we convert this:```cfor (j = 0; j < 4; j++)    summand[0][j] = leftrow[0] * row[0][j];for (j = 0; j < 4; j++)    summand[1][j] = leftrow[1] * row[1][j];for (j = 0; j < 4; j++)    summand[2][j] = leftrow[2] * row[2][j];for (j = 0; j < 4; j++)    summand[3][j] = leftrow[3] * row[3][j];```To this:```cfor (j = 0; j < 4; j++) {    summand[0][j] = leftrow[0] * row[0][j];    summand[1][j] = leftrow[1] * row[1][j];    summand[2][j] = leftrow[2] * row[2][j];    summand[3][j] = leftrow[3] * row[3][j];}```Are we sure the compiler will not detect vectorizable code and provide the same result than the first case?I'm just curious.

Battle에는 유저와 비유저를 구분하지 않고 사용하는 함수가 있어요.LivingUnit과 Unit의 차이점이 없다고 말씀하시는 건가요? BattleStage에 LivingUnit리스트로 만들어서 유저와 몬스터 모두 집어넣어 놓았습니다.

A person who wishes to use this library on GAE can therefore not easy just substitute their requestHandler for the GAERequestHandler and make it work on GAE....Would you be able to pull this request to a new branch on your side for a separate library just for GAE?

Sometimes it is unavoidable though:* when I just want to make sure that a method was not called:```self.assertFalse(ScriptStatusMock.notify_immediate.called)```* I think that I should not be testing error messages  only the severity of the message and let the body change at will. The assert_* methods allow me to only check whole call. So sometimes I resort to this:```self.assertEqual(ScriptStatusMock.notify_immediate.call_args[0][0] 'unknown')```

Though this brings up the question: what happens if two parsers sign up for the same suffix? Right now  we'll just lose the other one  and the order is reversed. This seems somewhat problematic… At minimum  I feel like we should: - Be prescriptive about what order they'll be considered in (i.e.  in the `LiftRules` docs  say “if multiple things register for the same suffix  the (first|last) one will win”). - Think about alternate approaches to first/last one wins. Don't have any suggestions right now  and I don't think we need that solution before merging this stuff  but I think it's worth sticking it in the back of our minds and seeing if we can think of something.

Right now I don't think the code can handle switching cameras. For one there is no setActiveCamera() method yet: the camera is created in the constructor and stay the same. So  I just formalized what I think it's the state of affair. Also  RenderableWorld has a pregenerateChunk() method that is only called on world loading time. The method RenderableWorldImpl.updateChunkInProximity() might be enough to regenerate the world around a new camera  but I need to verify that. For sure  RenderableWorld currently has no facility to switch cameras.That been said  it is something I'd like to sort out. I just need to understand better what needs to be updated when the camera changes. For the time being I can:1. rename the camera to something like ""playerCamera""2. remove the final keyword3. add a TODO and leave it as it is  to be worked on in one of the next PRsWhat do you prefer?"

I think the best approach for v3.x is to add a switch to melt to specify the binary output directory. If not specified  don't extract binaries. And that could be all internal to melt rather than a DTF change. Another approach would be to do kinda what dark does and extract files and binaries to their own subdirectories. That's also a behavior change but I could be convinced it's OK...

I did look at the message and tried to see if I could figure something out. At first I thought that it was a MODE B  but with more channels  but when I applied this  the CRC calculation failed. That is when I tested the previous (i.e. MODE B) method on the ""inner"" message instead. The CRC calculation matches and the result can be converted to channel data in the same way as for standard MODE B. So  for this implementation I simply ""discard"" the outer part of the message (but it does sync on the first 0xA1 byte. It seems to work very good  but I am not very happy with not using all of the bytes received. Note also that the baud rate is not the same as for the standard XBUS receiver.Maybe you can see any pattern in the data not used? I do not think it is an empty frame as it ""surrounds"" the MODE B frame I am using. However all ideas on interpreting this are welcome!"

This prompts a question though: why does the animation system needs times in 1000s of seconds?Thank you for the information about PerformanceMonitor  now I understand its purpose and usage much better. For what I have seen in the code there isn't a huge amount of multiple return location. But I didn't think about this aspect before and I'll now double-check to make sure that each startActivity is appropriately matched by an endActivity. Given that this is the only concern on the matter however  I will generally move those statements within methods. I really feel that they fragment the code too much  especially the high-level methods. And the issue of multiple return location is probably easily addressable within this area of the codebase.

I'm not sure I understand the differences between get_db_save and get_db_value though. It seems weird that there are both methods anyway.Preparing the value for use in SQL shouldn't be different between SELECT and UPDATE  but there may be cases that I'm unaware of that do require differentiation.

So you have a perfect circular reference which prevents any of the three objects from being destructed because the interpreter doesn't know in which order.To break the cycle  you can add:    class Example(object):        def __del__(self):            print ""deleted""    example = Example()    example = NoneThe last statement removes the reference to the ""example"" instance from the exec environment - thereby breaking the cycle. If you now run this through web2py  it will print ""deleted"".When you import a module  the Python interpreter will do this setting to None automatically - which is why this does not happen for imported modules.However  knowing this  you can avoid the problem - and hence very well put the class inside config.py since you do not have a destructor  or even if you had one  you would know how to break the cycle."

And it is. And it's not. Quality is important because it makes projects easier to maintain. Have you heard of the [Broken Window Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory)Basically  if an abandoned building has broken windows  people think that it's so abandoned that anybody can spray graffiti or demolish it or do whatever they like. Just because it has broken windows. But if the windows are all fixed people leave it alone and don't make it worse. The same goes with code. If the code is neat  structured and consistent people who come and work on it will continue to uphold that tradition and will continue to follow that line. If the code is sloppy and different in different places it sets your mind that it's not important what you write so the quality slowly drops. And consistency is important because it makes it easier to read the code because you're mind doesn't get hung up on odd differences. Sorry for the long essay. I hope it helps. I hope the airmozilla code is going to last for a long time and continue to be maintained for many years.

It only tells it to at the configured breakpoint. I might have combined `convertQuery` and `convertToCollapsibles` into `collapsiblesBreakpoint`  a number for the max-width. If `null`  no convert.

The ratio: if no portIndex is defined  the default portIndex==0 is set  which is fine (== valid). If portIndex!=0  then a portIndex is explicitly set in the app definition. If this is the case  the portIndex should be valid  i.e. in the index set of the app.

The example works this way  too  but it's not too common to calculate the mean of the points on the pdf  since the pdf is known analytically and I can evaluate it at any point I want anyway. On the other hand  the `samples` is what I would measure in an experiment and then I would want to compare the mean of the samples in each bin with the red line (the analytical pdf).Just for the record: I think we are all well aware that in many practical cases  it is better not use a binned statistic to check if a measured distribution matches e.g. a maxwell distribution  but I this is an easy to grasp example that greatly helps to understand what the return values of this function are.

We can add some timeout directly to the read() method  but it is also violation of contract that read() should have :-(Or we can return -2 if it is end of block and -1 if it is only no data received yet.And I think that  while (!_serial->available()) {} is infinite loop.If complete block was already received  but _available is still > 0   it will deadlock whole CPU forever

Vimeo single-inherits from a data store object in order to read experiment info from the database  so it eased our integration there to treat everything as a trait instead of a class (essentially allowing multiple inheritance from the DB object and the planout experiment classes as well). But this increasingly seems to me like a special case and probably not one we should build the open source version around.After a bit more thought I'm thinking of consolidating into the following structure (to better mirror the Python version and use traits a bit more systematically):```Experiments/  |-- Logging/    |-- PSRLoggerTrait    |-- FileLoggerTrait (uses PSRLoggerTrait + logger to log to file)  |-- AbstractExperiment (mirror of the Experiment class in Python)  |-- DefaultExperiment (unchanged)  |-- SimpleExperiment (uses FileLoggerTrait)Namespaces/  |-- AbstractNamespace (provides higher level methods + implements addExperiment etc. in terms of these methods)  |-- SimpleNamespace (implements higher level methods using dictionaries)```As you can see I yet to do anything with the interpreter but ideally that would be a nice next step. I'm also interested to hear what @tsujeeth and @GregBowyer think!

Why is this namespace special?  Why not just put the policies in the default namespace?  I think there's a conceptual gap here - you're trying to define something that controls namespaces inside of them.  We probably need to work backwards from use cases instead

This caused node-RED to exit ungracefully with an error. Testing for the existence of the device before trying to open it guards against starting node-RED when I've forgotten to plug in the RFXtrx433 resulting in a crash. Hence I needed a device path in the test code which is always guaranteed to exist.More recently I have been working on gracefully handling plugging in and unplugging the RFXtrx433. This caused me to delve deeper into the problem  and I think I have a better solution now. The uncaught exceptions were being thrown because the default behaviour for Serialport is 'open immediately'  however this is done from a process.nextTick() callback so any exception thrown by the open() is on a different call stack and cannot be caught. I'm now manually opening the Serialport only after the event handlers have been installed  so a failing open() emits an error event.It turns out there is a race condition which occasionally causes the open() to fail even if the device does exist at the time of the test (probably contact bounce when inserting the USB plug) so I have to handle failing open() calls anyway. I will try removing the exit test & see if I still have all the error cases covered. If so  we can happily remove the icky-ness!

It is easy to describe and conceptualize resource kind and namespace based policy rules.  By having PolicyRuleBindings  Roles  and RoleBindings as different resource kinds  it becomes easy to control who has rights to change individual aspects of policy.It seems reasonable that someone would want to allow a group of users to modify the project description  but want a much smaller group of users to modify the policy rules restricting that project.  Keeping the resources separate makes it easy to express that scenario.

Note that  by definition  any document in the enties collection has an attributes array  thus the try/catch should not be needed if we capture the error in a early place.In particular  looking to the logs after executing the .test included in this PR I have found this:```time=2015-01-02T19:31:16.884CET | lvl=DEBUG | trans=1420223475-825-00000000001 | function=entitiesQuery | comp=Orion | msg=MongoGlobal.cpp[1108]: retrieved document: '{ $err: ""Exterior shell of polygon is invalid: { type: ""Polygon""  coordinates: [ [ [ -70.652788  -33.603458 ]  [ -70.64603200000001  -33.604231 ]  [ -70.646781...""  code: 16693 }'```Thus probably a better strategy is to check if the ""$err"" field exists in the `r` document just after `LM_T(LmtMongo  (""retrieved document ...`) and  in that case  return the proper error response to the user (I'd suggest a 500 Internal Error  using the text in ""$err"" to fill the details field). I think that is better than a ""No context element found"" (as in the current version in the code) which may be hidding structural problems in geoquery done at DB.That way we would avoid Orion to crash. However  we can do even better detecting those ""Exterior shell of polygon is invalid"" situation before interacting with DB  fixing them if possibe or reporting the user with a 400 Bad Input error about the problem if the situation is not easy to fix. Looking to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21870088/exterior-shell-of-polygon-is-invalid  it seems they happen when the polygon have duplicated coordinates (this seems to be easy to detect) or is an ""intersection polygon"" (I'm not sure if al algorithm to reorder coordinates is easy to implement). Maybe the 500 Internat Error solution is enough for this PR. If detecting and fixing ""Exterior shell of polygon is invalid"" situations is difficult  we can defer it to a tech debt issue (nicetohave?)."

It's true that the DOF belongs to its joint  but one of the purposes of the DOF class is to offer a more flexible way of accessing joint properties. In particular  I think it's valuable for the user to be able to customize DOF names however they'd like to  and then access those names through the Skeleton::getDof(string) function. For that to work  we need the Skeleton to manage DOF name uniqueness. We could enforce name uniqueness requiring a [JointName].[DofName] style as you're suggesting  but that would detract from customizability.

How do they recover the cluster?I see two likely possibilities.  1) Hope you kept backups.  2)  A check to see if the creation/modification/deletion of a PolicyRuleBinding/Role/RoleBinding results in a situation that leaves you unable to modify the object that you are mutating.The latter is probably nicer in the common case  but it could be annoying in certain cases where you really do want to give up access and in cases where you're doing bulk modification of rules.

I don't see that as very common - it's more likely an admin wants to assign the same policy to multiple namespaces  and either modifies the shared policy  or clones it and mutates their new copy.  The objective of flexible policy is to give more control over permissions - not to mutate policy in bulk.  We do not need to have a generic policy engine - instead we need to design the policy options we need to support.  I don't think its a use case to modify a single policy and add or remove namespaces it controls  because the project is ultimately the resource that policy derives from.  The policy rules need to be set up so that admins can control policy mutation within a project  and control creation of a new project and the modification of what policies are applied to the project.

This seems reasonable at first glance  but is mutating ""Night Vision"" into ""High Night Vision"" really mixed?Is there a reason just comparing the point values to each other doesn't work right?

It can be removed if unused  but risk is to forget to add an important required `__future__` import in a later commit. Usually  in projets with python 2&3 support  I keep the same `__future__` imports in every files even if unused.Keeping those imports in each files makes python2 behaves like python3 without having to think about it too much.I didn't add `unicode_literals` import because it mess things up with the `struct.pack` and `struct.unpack` functions.

I will check it now  but I anticipate the answer is that it will give the same result.And yes  _""readability over performance""_ is a good  slow but steady way to ultimately achieve better performance.  I agree about prioritizing that over performance or premature optimization. :) That  and future developers understand the key to each algorithm like you said.  Forcing non-portable code or prematurely optimizing for a limited span of targets (e.g. always use SSE intrinsics) generally worked better in the long run for closed-source projects or those that don't fully appreciate some benefits of open-source.So if we convert those 4 separate loops I wrote into one single loop as you implied  GCC yields:  the exact same output for both methods!  So yes  your method of changing my loop produces the exact same output within almost certainly any compiler intelligent enough to vectorize them in the first place.  To be more specific  the output it produces is:`movss   xmm0  DWORD PTR leftrow``shufps  xmm0  xmm0  0``mulps   xmm0  XMMWORD PTR row``movaps  XMMWORD PTR summand  xmm0``movss   xmm0  DWORD PTR leftrow+4``shufps  xmm0  xmm0  0``mulps   xmm0  XMMWORD PTR row+16``movaps  XMMWORD PTR summand+16  xmm0``movss   xmm0  DWORD PTR leftrow+8``shufps  xmm0  xmm0  0``mulps   xmm0  XMMWORD PTR row+32``movaps  XMMWORD PTR summand+32  xmm0``movss   xmm0  DWORD PTR leftrow+12``shufps  xmm0  xmm0  0``mulps   xmm0  XMMWORD PTR row+48``movaps  XMMWORD PTR summand+48  xmm0``ret`As to whether I'd prefer my method of writing the loops or your method of unifying them in a single loop  they both look good to me.  Yours is probably better for organizing the same ""type"" of operation going on within its own body of its own loop; mine mostly just focuses on representing each SIMD instruction in C loop form for each individual one  with only a theoretically better chance at enforcing the vectorization individually.  It's a hard syntactical habit of mine for me to break.But there is also an option C) here as well if you are interested:  You could also do--`int j  k;``for (k = 0; k < 4; k++)``    for (j = 0; j < 4; j++)``        summand[k][j] = leftrow[k] * row[k][j];`"

This is why most of the fields are marked as optional in the proposed definition. From the [protobuf docs](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview)>You can add new fields to your message formats without breaking backwards-compatibility; old binaries simply ignore the new field when parsing. So if you have a communications protocol that uses protocol buffers as its data format  you can extend your protocol without having to worry about breaking existing code.

Unfortunately  I just checked  and it did not provide the same assembly language results.It added dynamic shuffle instruction code due to the new `k` variable  where shuffling one element across all four single-precision floating-point elements of the 128-bit xmm was no longer as fixated when using a loop variable instead of a literal 0  1  2  3 for array index.This is unfortunate I think  since we seem to agree that this option C) at the bottom of my reply is more readable.  Maybe it will go away in a future version of the GCC compiler  and you can use it without any performance loss whatsoever.  I sometimes observe that the current version of GCC is not good at auto-vectorizing but that the upcoming release of GCC will have such volatility fixed; you can try that if you want.  I am currently compiling on 32-bit Linux with GCC 4.8.2; you might have a better version for this particular limit.Here is the exact   full C code I am using to debug this btw:```float summand[4][4]  leftrow[4]  row[4][4];int main(void){    register unsigned int j  k;    for (k = 0; k < 4; k++)        for (j = 0; j < 4; j++)            summand[k][j] = leftrow[k] * row[k][j];    return 0;}```Compiled with:`gcc -S -O3 -msse2 -o /home/no/m64/main.s /home/no/m64/main.c`Omit the `-msse2` flag if compiling in GCC for 64-bit x86 code.Check `main.s` for the assembly language results of the code.It was the same with the first two methods I gave  but the third method for all its readability and flexibility seems less rigid to the compiler's ability to guarantee single-move shuffling in the SHUFPS op-code.

Should the same be done for `BeAKindOf` (currently in `be_kind_of.rb`) and `BeAnInstanceOf` (currently in `be_instance_of.rb`) also?Note that  as far as I can tell  the matcher class names contain the `A` and `An` for the purpose of automatically generating the matcher descriptions rather than anything else.

You could use RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView  and override create/delete functions (which I believe exist  but i'm not sure are necessarily named as such).

The bencode could fail for various reasons  such as if the object passed to it contains objects of types that are not bencodable.  One could construct malformed requests that would reliably produce at least the first kind of those failures—I'm not as sure about reliably reproducing the second kind.

They are the location to do all of the validation logic --- and they provide alot of the basic validation for you out of the box. http://tomchristie.github.io/rest-framework-2-docs/api-guide/serializersi imagine you will want to use custom fields.Let me know if you need some guidance setting this up  they can be tricky to set up and dive into without some background.

The scenario that has stung me in the past is when group_id is not in kwargs. This could be guaranteed if you're using a rigid well defined serializer --- but if you're not  then i would make sure to handle that scenario so a catastrophic 500 error isn't thrown.You could handle this through a try/catch or by using kwargs.get('group_id'  None) which returns None if group_id isn't there. Then you can handle the scenario with an if statement.Both approaches are valid.

Whenever you have code that has a dependency on some other value  there are lots of ways of getting that value in scope. People always end up making traits and classes and so on to get that to happen. But you know how else you can make code in a function depend on a value? With an argument. It's amazingly simple and I'm always baffled people don't just do this everywhere.

You can't seem to create a temp ref which you can use. Also the annoying thing and reason this isn't the best is that if the user `F5's` the page or go's back you are left with an empty ref on firebase which you then need to manage  not great really.

Better to put this in a separate class with just this table (this is the usual practise for optional cross-module linkages). I'd be tempted to put this into the Event module as this already has a lot of these optional linkages.

This will lead to inconsistent DB structure!!This should be an atomic check: All succeeds or All fails.I think this check should be done at the *record* level  not just the table level  as permissions here can very much be at the record level.The check for HTTP GET is incorrect heer too as this functionality will currently only ever accessed via GET  so these permission checks will never be done  and the DB status will never be updated in sendtable/tracktable & we will always have inconsistent data...bad  bad  bad.The fuinctionality is accessed by clicking on this Action Button:https://github.com/flavour/eden/blob/master/modules/s3db/inv.py#L3600I suspect the 'Avoid DB modifications from GETs should remain for now as too hard to fix that (NB it wasn't fixed here anyway as the Req status was still getting updated!)

That way if the test fails it'll be easier to debug  and also you ensure that some assertions are actually made (some changes to the model might make it so that to fields pass `is_reverse_object` and then the test does nothing).

(as recommended in the official python docs --https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html#drop-support-for-python-2-5-and-older-at-least). It's a slim requirement and the chances are most users already have it installed due to it being a very common dependency.Otherwise  we'll have to add even more unneeded copy/paste style boilerplate to `compat` in order to have proper metaclass unit tests in both python 2/3... It also provides things like `six.class_types`  `six.get_unbound_method` which are done differently in 2/3 and could be handy here.

I guess it would not compile.Thought I highly doubt that any `Exrabbit.Formatter` will be published (except the most popular and obvious one)  this change doesn't break this capability  but only extend it. It just allows you to write your own custom formatters without obligating users to write wrappers.

The problem is that `SimpleJson.Tests` is compiled against .NET 4.0. So to run the code  you need to recompile the test project against .NET 4.5 and change its reference to point to `SimpleJson-Net45`. Is that good enough for now?Otherwise  you might consider adding a `SimpleJson.Tests-Net45`

This is actually great  I've never messed with these before but you can be sure they're going to see a lot of use over in `QuDirac` as well...My comment before about `NTuple`s not being suitable for non-uniform factor bases is invalid - I'll make the change this weekend. Also  I don't think there is anything to worry about in regards to tuple performance - they're more compact than normal arrays and their immutability gives the compiler a slight advantage in some cases (of course  there are many instances where mutable arrays *should* be used  but I think that `NTuple` really is the right way to go here).

In this case  `upvote` and `downvote` are really special cases of `create` or `update`. You can specify whether it is an upvote or downvote by passing in a value through the form (as a hidden field): a value of 1 is an upvote  -1 is a downvote.

In particular  my point is  only the C code (also thought of as the ""auto-vectorized"" code) has universal meaning.  Anything else like inline assembly  or assembly language intrinsics  is in the eye of the beholder and not naturally readable code to everyone--because  its readability is dictated more by the target processor.For example  suppose you might prefer the intrinsic use:`ALIGNED int32_t a[4]  b[4]  c[4];int main(void) {    *(__m128i *)c = _mm_and_si128(*(__m128i *)a  *(__m128i *)b);    return 0;}`However  I find it even more readable to both the human and the compiler (for better optimizations outside the version of the SIMD instruction set architecture assumed by the usage of that intrinsic) to instead say:`int a[4]  b[4]  c[4];int main(void) {    register unsigned int i;    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++)        c[i] = a[i] & b[i];    return 0;}`Although the name of the `_mm_and_si128` intrinsic is self-explanatory as to the operation of the code  the algorithm itself is more readable and more natural when using C code (and the compiler is left to generate what should be the best choice of SIMD intrinsic for and'ing all elements).  This commit probably isn't the best example of that  however--you're welcome to disagree whether my C loops are as readable as some of the old code.  The gist of it may have been portability  but I thought it was more readable to divide each parallelized step of the overal algorithm into its own loop.  The original C loop code you had was much better than mine  thougin terms of shortness and brevity--maybe open to interpretation on the parallel steps what goes on.  So I think it's fine if certain sketchy examples of this practice come up that you like to comment about."

These are not automatically generated assets based on a naming convention! These are specific materials generated by the rendering system. They are also purely for the internal usage of the rendering system - these are the materials used by the ShaderParameter classes. Ideally we would eventually phase them out  replaced with a shader variable semantics support or something  but because that is quite a body of work not really worth messing with.There is not a one to one relationship between materials and shaders  and in general a shader does not have enough information to generate a material (since it doesn't have values for the shader's variables - this is why a material exists). A shader is included in the MaterialData class used to generate a material. So if you want a material for a given shader  you make it.

I don't think that it seems worth doing this as part of this work/release  since it causes API changes for users  that we are trying to  mostly  avoid. On the other hand  sending extra information to the server and back that we don't use anywhere  don't intend to  and nobody cares about  seems excessive  especially if we are planning to deprecate the entire feature. Here is a strawman: don't send testOnly to the server (it just seems wrong); change testOnly to only affect local packages. That doesn't affect most users  makes sense (we don't publish test packages as packages anyway  and that's the most common use case)  and brings us closer to our goal (deprecate it). Though maybe it doesn't actually make sense  IDK. Going to think about this for a bit  but posting some thoughts in case you have some in turn.

The asynchronous nature of file watching is difficult to capture  but I think you nailed it.My only concern is that if the test times out for some reason  the `watchProc` won't get killed since that only happens in this listener.  I'm thinking we should move it out into an `after` [hook](http://mochajs.org/#hooks) to prevent any zombies.  Something like:```javascriptdescribe('jade --watch'  function() {  // enclose the whole suite  var watchProc;  var stdout = '';  it('watch test one'  function() {})  // first test  it('watch test two'  function() {})  // second test  after(function() {  // runs after the suite (both tests) finish    if (watchProc != null) watchProc.kill('SIGINT');  });});```

You would never be able to write```rustlet cmp = Rev;```anyway  because `Rev` contains a field  which is the comparator that it is reversing. We _could_ make the field of `Rev` (and the other adapters) public  like```rustpub struct Rev<C>(pub C);```and then you could write```rustlet cmp = Rev(Natural);```without importing `CompareExt`  but you would still have to import `Natural` and `Rev`  obviously. One positive effect of making those fields public (and it's unlikely that the representation would ever change for adapters that are so simple) is that the adapters could be used in constant expressions. The benefit of `CompareExt`  which would presumably be in some kind of prelude once we get those  is that you don't have to `use` the individual adapter types.

If we need to we can add an `allPages` method later on.

These base classes maintain the Value property and the serialization logic for the value. For sliders  we only need to add the notion that  in addition to a Value property we need Minimum  Maximum  and Step properties as well. I did originally implement a base class called SliderBase  but because our double and integer classes already have their type defined  I would have to inherit instead from BasicInteractive<T>  and in so doing  would lose the logic we already have for properly serializing and deserializing int and double values. I'll reinvestigate to see if this can be improved.

They usually show up with ` otool `. Build deps are only needed during the compile stage  commonly things like ` pkg-config `  ` cmake `  ` libtool `  etc. Because we bottle things  when users install from a bottle  they don't have to install the build-time deps.I'd be surprised if ` miniupnpc ` wasn't run-time  given its general purpose  and the fact the two projects Twister was spun off of were Bitcoin and Libtorrent  and Bitcoin has a ` configure ` switch for ` miniupnpc `. It might be a case that it needs specifically enabling somewhere.

It happens to be a _bound_ variable. The variable `x` is bound to the value 5 in this case.We can discuss and clarify this larger point in normal comments below  if needed.

Pre-mocking helps a bit  but it relies on the fact that `requireApp('homescreen/js/grid.js');` is asynchronous and I'd prefer to avoid such racy code if possible.Otherwise  `GridManager` is well-designed: all initialization happens explicitly in `GridManager.init` which is called in tests' `setupSuite`. Let's use that.I suggest you remove the assignment to `_` in `GridManager` and instead use `navigator.mozL10n.get` everywhere in the js/grid.js file.  This will fix the `TypeError` because you won't be trying to access `navigator.mozL10n.get` when `navigator.mozL10n` is `undefined`.  OTOH  when `GridManager.init` is called  you will have already mocked `mozL10n` in `setupSuite` and any subsequent `navigator.mozL10n.get` calls will call into `MockL10n`.Let me know what you think about this approach.

So.  **What should clicking the Notification Icon really do in this case?**  I imagine users expect it to focus the Notifications portlet?  So maybe rather than suppressing the portlet rendering in the content pane  the solution should be suppressing the portlet rendering in the sidebar?

There are two distinct concepts here.  There's the question of whether other (non-gemini) catalog servers must be supported vs whether only a single catalog being hosted by a server need be supported. My understanding is that no other servers need be supported (and so no UI choice) but that we will still need a few of the catalogs.  AGS of course has its own defaults and doesn't prompt the user but a manual search still might provide catalog options.  I guess we should seek clarification here.

Looks like it could save a lot of boiler plate when writing value classes that you put into hash maps and trees.  I'm leaning toward not using it here though for the following reasons:1) We aren't putting these in hash maps or sorted data structures.  We don't need equals/hashCode/toString at the moment2) Some of the fields are derived. I'll have to change that up because you have to specify all the fields in the constructor.3)  Its not being used elsewhere in the code. I'll have to explain why I chose it and its not compelling for above reasons 1 & 2.4) I'll have to add a new external dependency.

It saves a bit on indentation. i.e. ```javascript_getUserIdFromLoginId(loginId  function(err  userId) {    if (err) {        return callback(err);    } else if (!userId) {        callback({'code': 400  'msg': 'This login id does not exist and is not associated to any user'});    }    // More logic here..});```That said  I *think* the `_getUserIdFromLoginId` will return a 404 if the userId could not be found so there might be no need for the `else if` clause.

This does not happen on travis. If you do this locally  it will fail at the moment - we need to harmonise panic values between the two implementations. My proposal would be to drop the c from the beginning of the cblas panics and use those in both - the reasoning being that those messages are more informative (they give a stringer hint to which parameter was incorrect).

You don't think this view is at all related to the existing url view?What should that view give on other types?  Seems illogical for it to be a link at all  which is why I think it should come back as core or raw view (core seems right  but I'm not sure it matters).  We just want to see something when this view is used on other types  otherwise debugging is harder.

22402081,fcb7df632df10326fda0eda8e3592c468005fe70,https://github.com/dnanexus/dx-toolkit/pull/84#discussion_r22402081,kislyuk,2015-01-01T20:28:04Z,IMO it's better to preserve the simpler semantics of passing the unmodified timeout value to requests (which then sets it on the socket) than it is to change it to ensure that we spend no more than `timeout` before returning (which is not a guarantee that the caller can fully rely on anyway  since it's not anything like a real-time system). The scenario of the first few requests returning quickly and the last one hanging (which is necessary to trigger the scenario of significantly missing the timeout deadline before returning) seems far-fetched to me. I agree there is a minor correctness issue  but the two applications of the timeout value really deal with different issues: the one passed to requests and set on the socket takes care of stalled out requests  while the one checked in the retry loop takes care of breaking out of the 503 retry-later mode.(We may also want to investigate using urllib3's retry support  which was introduced over the course of 2014. Maybe it better deals with this socket/total timeout duality?)

It's based on xcrun definitions for c/c++. It doesn't exclude win32 because  unlike xcrun  bash can be installed on win32 and it should work. It's wrapped as single command to bash to invoke two commands as single one - compilation and actual execution of the binary.It's true  that it's not perfect - in the same way c/c++/objective-c definitions are not perfect. They don't quote file paths properly so if there's a space in the real path  it'll fail. That's the problem with all of those definitions. Also they use hacky way of invoking two commands as one by wrapping everything as bash one-liner.If you agree to merge it I can send another patch with fixes for those definitions:- proper escaping of shell params  and- support for multiple command invocation (for compile-and-run languages) so we don't need to go through bash.

Ook in SQL zelf is zoiets eigenlijk ook inefficient geimplementeerd (hiervoor worden eerst alle mogelijke resultaten opgehaald  waarna er random gesorteerd wordt  waarna het eerste resultaat teruggegeven wordt).Als je een goed idee hebt dat qua UI ook werkt  maar dus niet random is  mag het natuurlijk ook.

The expression should not need to know what kind of compiler is being used here. Why is this necessary here  but hasn't been required before? Is this something that resolve_ref can handle without full knowledge of the type of compiler? Or do we need to re-add a similar get_db_prep method into expressions?

Do you have objections to invitations only being sent if an inviting user can be determined? The invitee is added using the CompanyUser form  so that will always result in an invitation. This will prevent it from sending an invitation for postajob created CompanyUsers  though.

That's why I mentioned it in my initial comment.```SQLUpdateCompiler``` calls ```field.get_db_prep_save(val)``` on raw values  but it's not happening with Value objects.So ```qs.update(field=value)``` works but ```qs.update(field=Value(value))``` fails for ```Field```s that require conversion. I've added test cases to ```tests.expressions``` that fail without this.```UUIDField``` is problematic for MySQL.```UUIDField```  ```TimeField``` and ```DurationField``` are problematic for SQLite.I did the compiler type check here  since I'm not sure values should be processed with ```get_db_prep_save``` in the other compiler types.

If the volume is muted via hotkey the volume slider will still show a value  and changing the slider will not unmute the audio.![Audio configuration](http://i.imgur.com/BUA0zRZ.png)Further improvements:* A mute/unmute button/icon in the audio configuration. * A button will probably not fit the window without reorganizing its content. * An icon is in my opinion a better indicator. See image below for a suggestion (muted audio icon borrowed from http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Mute_Icon.svg).* Disable volume slider when audio is muted? Unmute audio if volume slider is changed?* Visual feedback when changing volume or muting/unmuting via hotkeys. Is graphical overlay possible? ![Audio muted](http://i.imgur.com/Yi8g3mz.png)

A method body should be easy to read. Simple variable names help us to read the method. When variable names are composite  they produce noise and reading is becoming more difficult and slow. So  when you need a composite name - refactor the method and make it shorter

There are cases where a player may have more than 100 + stamina HP  such as someone with 40 stam and a duke shield with 145HP who then loses his +5 bonus (so your equation would yield if 145 = 143 and return FALSE). They could of course die to remove these HP or boost their shield  but I guarantee people will instead complain that the system is broken.

Разработка нового кровеносного сосуда требует активации и миграцию различных типов клеток  в основном [[эндотелий]]  [[гладких мышц]] и [[перицитов]].Точный механизм  с помощью которого мутации HHT влиять на этот процесс еще не ясен  и вполне вероятно  что они нарушают баланс между про- и антиангиогенных сигналов в кровеносных сосудах. Стенка телеангиэктазий необычно рыхлая  из-за чего они и кровоточат.

Гормоны не проникают в клетку  но связываются с рецепторами на клеточной мембране; Затем они активируют другие белки  в конечном счете  влияющие на клеточное поведение в ряде способов  таких как клеточной выживаемости  пролиферации (увеличение числа) и дифференциации (становятся более специализированными). [1] Для сигналов гормона  чтобы быть адекватно трансдуцированных  сочетание белков необходимо: две каждого из двух типов серин / треонин-киназы конкретных типов мембранных рецепторов и эндоглина. При связан с гормоном  белки рецепторов типа II фосфорилируют (передачи) на фосфат типа I рецептор белки (из которых Alk-1 является одним)  которые  в свою очередь фосфорилирует комплекс СМАД белков (главным образом Smad1  SMAD5 и SMAD8). Эти связываться с SMAD4 и мигрируют в ядро клетки  где они действуют как факторы транскрипции и принимают участие в транскрипции определенных генов. В дополнение к пути SMAD  мембранные рецепторы также действовать на пути MAPK  который имеет дополнительные действия на поведение клеток. [2] Как Alk-1 и эндоглин выражены преимущественно в эндотелии  может быть  объясняет  почему ННТ вызывающих мутации в эти белки ведут преимущественно проблемы кровеносного сосуда. [2] [8] как ENG и ACVRL1 мутации приводят преимущественно недопроизводству из родственных белков  а не неправильное функционирование белков.

It doesn't define a few things though. What is your take on these cases?```escript.install ./local_file        # ./ is used to distinguish from a hex packageescript.install path/to/local_file  # cannot be a hex package  so it can imply a local pathescript.install path path/to/local_repo  # ugly# What about this? Should we forbid fetching remote scripts?escript.install ??? https://example.com/escript_file```I realize that in the common case hex packages should be preferred  but we still have to define what happens with the other cases.The ambiguity of supporting a prebuilt escript could be solved with a dedicated task:```escript.install-file local_fileescript.install-file path/to/local_fileescript.install-file http://example.com/escript# or a flagescript.install --file local_file# etc...```It may not be all too important to be able to install prebuilt escripts  but leaving it out makes it feel incomplete.What do you think  @josevalim  @ericmj ?

The answer it returns has the correct values inthe lower triangular part  but not in the upper triangular part.Consider this test:using Convex  SCSset_default_solver(SCSSolver())y = Semidefinite(3  is_symmetric=false)p = minimize(y[1  2]  y[2  1] <= 1  y[1  2] >= -10)solve!(p)julia> y.value3x3 Array{Float64 2}: 4.91931   -10.0      0.0 0.903817    4.91931  0.0 0.0         0.0      0.0julia> y.value[1 2] = y.value[2 1]; eigvals(y.value)3-element Array{Float64 1}: 0.0 4.01549 5.82313So if we explicitly symmetrize  we do find that the matrix is PSD.But the solution to that problem ought to be that y[1 2] and y[2 1] areboth -10  not that they're both .903817.

[Constants Must Appear Before Fields] (http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1203.html)2. [All static elements must be placed above all instance elements of the same type] (http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1204.html)3. [Elements Must Be Ordered By Access] (http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1202.html)4. Alphabetical orderWhen a member has no access keyword  such as private/public  the private value is assumed  thus ```const int x = 0``` is the same as ```private const int x = 0``` as you said.```const int x = 0;``` is the second to appear because is a private const. So it came after a public const field.Do you agree?

We do the same things again and again in all of our controllers. We load  save and build our model ready for saving. Building is the same concept for the new  create and update methods. The only difference is their state. So for new we build a model without an associated database record and empty params  the same for create but we wan't to merge in form params  with an update we are looking at merging in form params to an existing record. This method covers all bases and is DRY. - build a new partner if one doesn't exist - merge in attributes if there are anyadditionally Partner.new and Partner.build are just aliases https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/relation.rb#L124

This does make sense  however I am not a multi lingual site expert... but it seems to me we would want the order of the booleans to be this instead:```if (entity[field_name][language]) {  ...}else if (entity[field_name][default_lang]) {  ...}...```I say this because it seems the field's language should first try to grab the language from the entity itself  then fallback to the default language  and then finally fall back to `und`. What do you think?

I wouldn't mind a lot changing this  but I am writing another plugin right now that is pretty large using this convention consistently and it's really useful when reusing default keywords like `set` or `contains` as they are automatically highlighted by my editor. So I could for instance `msg._.str.contains` and `contains` would be highlighted adding readability without interfering with anything.

By looking at the function signature  the names ```existsArray``` and ```datumArray``` seem to be of same kind  but ```existsArray``` is an input argument and ```datumArray``` is a modify argument. I think we should make this more explicit. For example  we can rename ```datumArray``` to ```resultDatumArray```.2. Input arguments and output arguments are mixed.

If by chance  the first batch in this program does not have the published data and returns an empty RDD  there are hidden exceptions made which is recipe for failures in the future - flaky tests  etc. As I said earlier  see the KafkaStreamSuite for inspiration. It does a RDD.collect() and puts all the received data into a hashmap (could be a simple buffer/list in your case). Then the eventually verifies the data in the buffer.

If for some reason they decided to release 4.3 that would allow that version.  Unlikely  I know  but if your intention here is to explicitly not support rails 5+ that seems more semantically correct.  (OTOH  if you explicitly would not want to support 4.3 if that was ever released  this is fine).

Using the Condition API  each call to notifyAll() would be a different Condition object  while the Lock you obtain the Conditions from would stay the same (= the same SynchronizedDelayedBackground job).Notice however that IMHO the Condition API is sort of awkward  which leads to complexified code: Conditions have spurious wakeups as well  so Condition.await() returning does NOT mean that Condition.signal() was actually called. This means that you need an external way of detecting that it really was signalled (a boolean for example)  which sort of voids its purpose. One would expect that await() returning 100% means that signal() was called. This might be possible to simplify by writing a wrapper class around Condition  which maybe one of the popular Java class libraries already did."

I didn't understand this sentence. In the current Rails code  ActionDispatch callbacks do not halt the chain when returning `false`. That setting is currently only present in [ActiveModel](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/17227/files#diff-174733f2db65ef1bc53e3222d6ac0e61L20)  in [ActiveModel::Validations](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/17227/files#diff-0cd7b1cc8e754e9ab96c72b45770767dL26)  and in [ActiveRecord](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/17227/files#diff-174733f2db65ef1bc53e3222d6ac0e61L20).Since currently we **don't** expect ActionDispatch callbacks to halt upon returning `false`  and the new default terminator **will** halt upon returning `false` and display a warning (unless `config.active_support.halt_callback_chains_on_return_false` is set to `false`)  then I would add the following *custom* terminators for `#to_prepare` and `#to_cleanup`  so those callbacks will keep on **not halting** upon returning `false`:```rubydefine_callbacks :prepare  terminator: ->(_  result_lambda) { result_lambda.call if result_lambda.is_a?(Proc); false }define_callbacks :cleanup  terminator: ->(_  result_lambda) { result_lambda.call if result_lambda.is_a?(Proc); false }```Makes sense?

If you expect a uri and get a core  you're not likely to be happy.  there is already a :url view for *all (in base.rb).  I suppose we could alias to that.

I normally to run everything with `-v 2`  but the elapsed time is nothing that'd be useful unless I'm debugging something  which I would run with `-v 3` anyway.

In truth  I'd rather see several smaller PRs targeted specifically at areas that need to be addressed.  Why not start with the path constants and the handling of the favicon since the former seems to have caused problems with the PR changing those and the latter has been a known issue for quite some time.  Then either set up a Windows system to run the unit tests to see where there are path related errors (Hannes may be able to help with this  I know he runs the tests on occasion and has Windows) and branch out or just use the CMS and find problem areas related to path handling.  In the PHP code I know of that interacts with the local filesystem  I'm not aware of any that just blanket converts everything to using one separator style  so we should not need to either.

If you put debug logs here  you'll see it fires over and over when the user is aiming the turret in a cannon for example. This point I've raised here already and the comment makes clear the intention.So  perhaps in most cases the client wouldn't send commands when a player is rooted. But for rooted vehicles it does  and this falls foul of this code  which releases the root.Hence  it specifically makes an exception if on a vehicle. It's the crux of this PR and I cannot see any other way of solving the issue on a core level (without making various hacky tricks elsewhere).

We hook onto this in Cardio to load mods  but devs can also if need be.  This would make it easy to have several of those for loading mods in different places.  That might argue for configuring mods differently.  Maybe we don't need paths entries and just have the load call take an argument with the mod location.

That could be blocked for many seconds in an well-behaving application  such as a program that's bandwidth-limited.That means we unnecessarily delay the call to `listener.onClose()`

As implemented  we use URI for the cardtype name/codename2. In views  we make uri and url synonymous.  I know that technically they're not  but for now the effort to make it so that ""url"" balks at non-url uri's seems a bit unnecessary.3. Both of those views should actually return simple uris in pretty much every format. In other words  something like `http://wagn.org`  NOT `<a href=""http://wagn.org"">http://wagn.org</a>`4. For that latter case  we can create a new view called ""uri_link"".  In many formats this will just be a simple uri  but in HtmlFormat it will have a hypertext link.5. For all of the following views: uri  url  and uri_link  MOST cards will use the url of the card itself (based on the name)  but URI cards will use the content url.How does that sound?"

It isn't recommended - but for very specific reasons  which you can easily get around.If you don't trust my word  then an alternative could be to break the class up into functions and move those into config.py. It is questionable anyway whether this needs to be a class as you always only call a single function of the instance - but I understand that a class looks nicer and is perceived as easier to maintain.The ultimate solution for this sort of problems would be to import templates as modules (instead of executing them) - and move them into the module path (modules/templates). But that is truly a major framework change and would require hundreds of hours of work - not to even speak of the retraining of everyone who has ever worked on templates  so it is currently rather wishful thinking  or  as we use to say  something for 2.0 ;) We could equally well think of migrating Eden to django  or cherrypy.

If you are sane  you will *not* try to generalize that.

I am not sure though  if this makes sense - do you have any idea on the load that such a scan imposes on the system (e.g. on a Raspberry Pi)? Maybe it is better to not offer background discovery at all and only let users do a manual scan.

Not sure how it is used  but I guess it is a remainder from my original sweep of changing all deltas from milliseconds to seconds (easier to work with for game logic IMO).You can use ```try (Closable c = new Closable()) {}``` blocks in Java. The problem is the PerformanceMonitor framework was created before we switched to Java 7 that introduced it  so hasn't been set up so that activities are a Closable object.
